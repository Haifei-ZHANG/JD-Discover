        <description>With the ever-increasing scale of problems that are being tackled in science, health and engineering,
there has been a concurrent increase in the use of highly distributed computing to store and manipulate 
data. The time is now ripe to move from manipulating data to extracting and analysing information from
heterogeneous, distributed and autonomous sources.
Machine learning to analyse a single dataset based on a single platform is well-established. The 
challenge this project addresses is to scale the technology up to a distributed computing environment by
1. researching principled algorithms for the analysis of large-scale distributed datasets;
2. developing practical software tools that implement these algorithms; 
3. evaluating the algorithms on specific problems, such as bioinformatics or environmental modelling,
using the NCRG computer cluster as a testbed. It may also be possible to do some work on the
School Cray XD1 cluster as well. 

avenue of research : 
Distributed learning: if data is distributed across a number of computational nodes, it is possible
to learn a different model at each node. Bayesian methods can then be used to fuse the results of 
the different models. This approach is valuable when data cannot be centralised or is too large to
store on a single machine.
This project will require some use of FORTRAN or C matrix libraries, as well as Matlab programming: it 
is therefore only suited to confident programmers. There is also scope to investigate software engineering
issues as such service computing and using metadata.

Development of a procedure of analysis of the vibrations measured on vehicle, for the calculation of a subjective quotation of the vibratory comfort (`Ridemeter¿). The measurements will be done on vehicle and either on track or 4 jacks workbench. The measured vehicles will be judged in vibratory comfort by experts of the job, in order to obtain the reference quotations for the psycho-vibratory readjustment. The analysis of the vibratory measurements will have to allow to do the quotation of a measured vehicle.

The missions of the work experience include:
1.	bibliographic revision
2.	vehicle tests on roads/test bed (acceleration measurements)
3.	research of the weighting parameters
4.	proposition of the analysis of the measurements for the calculation of the subjective quotation
5.	documentation of the work + presentation of the results in work committee

At the end of the work experience a synthesis file will regroup: the bibliographic study of the Psycho Vibration, the created/used data base, the adopted parameters to make the calculation of the quotation from the vehicle measures, and the description of the routines or procedures under Matlab or Excel created for the analysis of the data.

        <description>Lipoxygenases are a class of widely distributed non-heme iron-containing enzymes, which catalyze the dioxygenation of polyenoic fatty acids containing at least one 1,4-cis,cis-pentadiene structural unit. From the different types of enzymes (5-, 8-, 12- and 15-lipoxygenases) the physiological role of human 15-lipoxygenase (15-LO) has been thoroughly investigated. It seems to be involved in various biological processes such as cell differentiation, inflammation, asthma, carcinogenesis and atherogenesis.
It is described to oxidatively modify LDL to an atherogenic form that is rapidly taken up by macrophages, which may develop into lipid loaden foam cells. These cells then induce the formation of atherosclerotic lesions in blood vessel walls. Inhibitors of 15-LO might reduce the risk for the development of atherosclerosis.
It has been demonstrate that LDL incubated with 15-LO cells is \&quot;minimally modified\&quot; and has bioactive properties. Characterization of LDL incubated with 15-LO cells reveals that lipid peroxidation is modest and, compared with LDL incubated on control cells, LDL incubated on 15-LO cells stimulated monocyte chemotaxis and when added to endothelial cells enhanced adhesion. This properties could be used to set up a secondary screening assay to evaluate the activity of 15-LO inhibitors on minimally modified LDL generation by cellular 15-LO.</description>

        <description>X-Ray images are inherently noisy by nature , caused by so-called quantum noise. In the literature median and Wiener type of filters hae been applied to denoise images. The results of this denoising filter are promising and might become an alternative approach to denoising X-Ray images, but need to be evaluated with other denoising methods.
The aim fo this project is to describe and evaluate several filtering techniques that reduce quantum noise in X-Ray images and implement an advanced noise filter in C++.</description>

        <description>A numerical prediction tool is developed, based on the hybrid method, in which the flow calculation (CFD) is decoupled from the acoustic propagation. This approach is suited to high-Reynods and low Mach numbers, characteristic of the aforementioned industrial fields. A number of issues has to be dealt with, reladed to the numerical accuracy and robustness of the technique. In particular, the correct interpretation of the CFD data as equivalent acoustical sources (monopoles, dipoles and quadrupoles) is troublesome and deserves further research. Numerical artefacts are also related to the mapping of the CFD data (computed over a fine mesh) towards the acoustic coarse mesh. Several algorithms are being developed and need be tested and upgraded in real industrial applications. These investigations will be based on the virtual. Lab simulation platform developed by LMS, involving the development of scripting functionalities to permit interfacing scientific computing sofware with the virtual. Lab database.</description>

        <description>The &quot;Device Log Mining&quot; project at XRCE aims at applying data mining and machine learning techniques to summarize large sets of printer-originated data (sensor readings or activity logs) and discover new features which are not obvious from the data. Visualization of both data and results is an important tool to convey information to the user, allowing him/her to navigate both in the data space or derived spaces. There are two kinds of contexts in which visualization is helpful:

    * informative visualization: here, the visualization is aimed at the person who exploits the results of the data analysis. This person is usually not an expert in data analysis and wants the information to be available in the most actionable form.
    * exploratory visualization: here, the visualization is aimed at the person who performs the data analysis. The needs are different: typically, visualization may help get acquainted with the statistical characteristics of the data, or validate a hypothesis, or select a model of the data.

The goal of this internship is to develop both informative and exploratory visualisation tools for a large data set associated with a fleet of Xerox high-volume printing devices. Most of the data is available as time series of high-dimensional observations (several thousand features), which pose specific challenges for visualisation. The results of the various data analysis techniques applied to this data set, for diagnosis or prognosis purposes (HMMs with their factorial variant, generative as well as discriminative classification techniques) also call for specific visualisation methods. One particular challenge is to explain the results of the analysis based on relevant exerpts of the data.

The internship will consist of several tasks:

    * understand the available data and design the requirements for a visualisation tool
    * look at the literature for relevant dimensionality-reduction and visualisation algorithm, esp. for time-series
    * implement some of the algorithms and embed them into a full-blown user interface

Note that all these tasks have already been addressed to some extent by past interns at XRCE. The current internship will elaborate on that basis.

The successful candidate will combine competences in user interface design and programming as well as in data-mining tools and techniques for high dimensional data.</description>

The Amadeus payment server is a highly available payment system that distributes payment request to a large set of bank establishment all over the world.

The team is also responsible for the form of payment used by the customer when buying a product and by all credit card issues (e.g. PCI/DSS).

The team, composed of 6 developers, is working in an international environment. 
Subject:	The Form Of Payment (FOP) is a database field that stores the form of payment used by a customer when paying for a flight ticket. It is currently stored as free text as there is no agreement between markets/airlines on a common set of format.

Amadeus has developed a system of regular expression that allows a check of the format of the form of payment. Thousands of formats are currently in use.

We will soon perform the migration of this system to more standard regular expressions (perl or POSIX).

Here are some of the challenges we will be facing:
- automatic regular expressions translation
- generation of example of matching string based on the regular expression alone
- collision detection (detect that two regular expressions may match common string).

The trainee will investigate and study solutions proposal based on the state of the art in regular expressions.
The student will also focus on the translation of constraints of Form of Payment, which will require special skills such as Operational Research and graph theory. Regular expressions might also require a study using graphs, also emphasizing the use of theory of the latter.
Required skills:	Good programming knowledge.

        <description>The figure illustrated above is a swash-plate axial piston pump, used for converting mechanical power into hydraulic power. The axial piston pump, have, over many years maintained their advantages over other power devices, by offering extreme power density together with high stiffness dynamic response. Such devices are used in the automotive, robotic and aerospace industries.
	The axial piston pump, of the in-line type, shown above, have their cylinders, item (4), and their drive shaft, item (13). parallel with each other. The reciprocating motion of the piston is created by a cam plate, also known as a wobble plate or swash plate item (8). For example, the one end of the piston rod is held in contact with the swash plate and as the cylinder block rotates this action causes the pistons to reciprocate relative to the cylinders, thus pumping hydraulic liquid.
	Variable delivery axial piston pumps are designed so that the angle of the swash plate can be varied from 20 to 25 degrees using the control fork item (12).
	The purpose of this interesting design project, is to first scan the web to discover various manufacturers of swash plate axial pumps and to establish a market niche. Having established a hydraulic pressure and flow rate, to then design a suitable pump. I would expect the student to also undertake a finite element analysis of the swash plate, so that the mass of the moving parts is kept to a minimum, whilst not jeopardising the stress and distortion of the swash plate.
	A further interesting design concept would be to have a planetary gear with shaft mounted brake, as illustrated on the next page. 
	An important part of this project is to produce `engineering drawings¿ describing machining tolerances and material selection.

        <description>Summary of responsibilities
Amadeus would like to study and implement a software tool able to set-up, for given flight-dates, an availability offering optimising the Airline revenues.
Responsibilities
Background
Amadeus manages the so-called Inventory system of various Airline companies. The Inventory is a system calculating booking class-based availabilities on all flights of an airline¿s network. Those availabilities are based on aircraft cabins capacities, on already booked seats, and on ¿inventory controls¿ (e.g., Authorisation Limits, also named AUs) given by an external module that we¿ll name Availability Allocator.
Dr. Peter Belobaba, Professor at the MIT (USA), has designed a method in order to calculate nearly optimised Authorisation Limits, given previously collected data on booking forecasts. That method is named EMSR, aka Expected Marginal Seats Revenue, and is presented and detailed in his thesis (dated May 1987).
In summary, the EMSR method modelises the class-based demand thanks to Gaussian curves, and then deduces class-based expected revenues. According to the corresponding expected revenues, ¿protections¿ (also called Authorisation Limits) are set-up for each class. When the expected revenue of an additional seat to be protected on a specific class becomes too low, the protection for that class is fixed and seats are then protected downward (in terms of expected revenues) the other classes.
Objective of the training
The intern will have to study and to implement an Availability Allocator, which will be able to send Authorisation Limits (AUs) data to the Airline Inventory system. As an option, tests may then be performed to check the consistency of the resulting availability offerings and of the forecasted bookings.
Required skills
The intern will have to demonstrate his personal skills to get integrated within a team, as well as his motivation to achieve a task within a limited timeframe. The trainee can speak and write in English on technical topics, and is confident with UML, Unix, and C++.
Technologies 
C++, Unix ,Java
The trainee will develop a prototype using C++ language on an Unix based platform (Solaris, HP-UX). The Authorisation Limits (AUs) data will be sent to the Airline Inventory system presented via an EDIFACT messages presentation format, and using the Amadeus framework.

        <description>Assist in improvement of the quality system, particularly to set ups tools improve efficiency-e.g..
In the Precast Factory a lot of data is collected during checks. Atool (excel) is needed to more easily present feedback of the types of quality problems that are occurring. A PDA could also be introduced to reduce repetitive data entry.
Improvements to the database used to collect concrete tests results to improve access to info by  sites and how the data is presented.
Support in following up quality issues concerning site wide works
There are certain works that common to the project (e.g. Viaducts, Reinforced Earth Wall, Palisade Fence, Noise barriers etc.). These tend to have common quality issues that ares time consuming to follow ups as many sites can be involved; Guillaume would assist in passing through the sites to follow up at the workface - for example:
The Reinforced Earth Wall is a system product installed by different subcontractors over the projet who should apply the same quality control but for example the proper reception of components, repair of defects, tests of backfill requires someone to ensure the requirements have been properly communicated and trained and that these are audited</description>

        <description>AIR PDS is a Product Definition team in charge of writing and
maintaining the functional specifications of several core products of
the Amadeus reservation system (including special services offered to
passengers).

AIR PDS team members (functional analysts):

  *
    Elaborate functional specifications for new / existing products.
  *
    Deliver test plans and test scenarios.
  *
    Test product in order to ensure compliance of the delivered
functionality and system integrity, and perform functional sign off.
  *
    Support other Amadeus groups (e.g. Help Desk)

Just like software, functional specifications need to be properly
maintained and updated. Over the years, the amount of functional
specification documents under the responsibility of AIR PDS team has
grown a lot (e.g. new documents introduced by big projects but also
incremental update of older documents). This leads sometimes to
information being duplicated or becoming obsolete. Even if a formal
change review process already exists, the overall organization of our
product specifications has to be audited in order to guarantee the
excellence of the quality of these critical documents.

Within the team, the trainee will participate in the study of the
following areas:

  * Inventory of existing product specifications
  * Categorization of these documents (generic documents, ad hoc
documents, cross-functional documents...)
  * Rationalization of these documents (which ones could be merged?
Which ones could be split? Which ones are redundant? Which ones are
candidates for being rewritten in UML? Which ones contains sections
that look more like interface documentations than actual
specifications? Which ones are missing a companion troubleshooting
guide?)
  * Improvement of the internal review process for functional specifications
  * Management of generic vs. customer-specific specifications
  * Identify the key criteria that justify the creation of a new
document (rather than updating an existing one)
  * Improvement of document version management and storage

The main goal of this internship is to study documentation that will
describe the status of our functional specifications and study actions
and/or procedures for improving current situation.

The trainee will be based in Sophia Antipolis but the study may
require spending a few days in Amadeus development center in London.</description>

        <description>Germain will study the vibration/tactile effects of sound reproduction in an automobile to determine their influence on listeners¿ sound quality judgments of the automotive audio system. The vibration/tactile effects of the audio system will be physically measured, and then simulated in listening experiments in combination with a binaural room scanning (BRS) capture/playback system that captures and reproduces the acoustical response of the automotive audio system through a head-tracking headphone system.  The study will address the importance of including tactile effects in BRS systems used for psychoacoustic experiments, and explore methods for accurately simulating their effect. These are important research questions that largely remain unaddressed in the scientific literature.</description>

        <description>To manage data and associated changes, Australian Aerospace chose to implement a Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) system. The selected tool is MatrixOne. The management of data includes files, processes, controls and relationships.

The project was initially broken down in 4 phases:
'	Phase 1: Data Management
'	Phase 2: Engineering And Configuration Management
'	Phase 3: Project Management
'	Phase 4: Other Requirements

Phase 2 is under implementation for the 1st platform (MRH90 helicopter) and will be installed on production at the beginning of 2009. Additional functionalities have to be developed and will be installed later during the 1st semester of 2009.
Then the solution must be rolled out to the 3 other platforms (Tiger helicopter, P3 Orion &amp; Caribou)

MatrixOne is a N-tiers architecture with Java, JSP and Oracle. It's using tcl and a dedicated language (Matrix Query Language: MQL) to interface with the database.

        <description>Within this team, the trainee will study the development of a web page embedding a Google Map on which the Travel Agencies are shown along with measures of their activity (e.g. the revenue they generated for a given airline). 

The trainee will also study the development of an executive dashboard showing airline financial performance, with Google Analytics. 

The Google Maps API lets you embed Google Maps in your own web pages with JavaScript. The API provides a number of utilities for manipulating maps (just like on the http://maps.google.com web page) and adding content to the map through a variety of services, allowing you to create robust maps applications on your website. 


The data concerning Travel Agencies activity (such as number of tickets, revenue generated by these tickets, etc, on various periods), as well as airline financial activity (such as earned revenue for departeds flights on a given route and given period), are held by the Revenue Accounting application. 






The trainee will participate in the following: 

- analyzing the Google Maps API 

- defining the relevant measures associated with the Travel Agency activity, and how to interface with the Amadeus database handling these data 

- analyzing how aggregations can be put in place according to the map scale 

- analyzing the Google Analytics API 

- defining the critical metrics associated with the airline financial activity, and the relevant aggregations and comparisons to be displayed an executive dashboard, 

- designing the architecture to integrate Google Maps, Google Analytics and Amadeus Revenue Accounting application 

- coding the prototype and testing it.</description>

        <description>Ring artifact correction for 3D rotational x-ray imaging.
The proposed project lies in the domain of 3D rotational x-ray. Nowadays 3D patient reconstructions with high image quality can be computed from series of digital 2D x-ray projections acquired while rotating around a patient. The 3D image quality approaches that of dedicated Computed Tomography scanners.
3D image quality is of great importance to Philips Healthcare and its customers. In the case of 3D, after performing all available calibrations and corrections, still some ring-shaped artifacts remain in the slices of the 3D reconstructions. This is due to the rotational nature of the acquisition and some non-ideal behavior of the pixel response of the x-ray detector. These artifacts are very weak but well visible, since the human eye has a great ability to detect structured noise.Currently an algorithm is available that does a good job in removing the more high-frequent rings, but more low frequent (broader) rings are not detected or corrected.
Goal of this project is to provide a sensitive, fast and robust algorithm to detect and correct ring artifacts, without introducing new artifacts. This algorithm should work well in a great variety of clinical scans, without any user interactions or parameter adjustment.
The candidate will have an opportunity to learn the basics of 3D reconstruction and its calibration steps and to understand the corresponding artifacts. Since 3D imaging uses a large amount of data, speed will be an issue (code optimizations such as SIMD or use of GPU can be considered).The algorithm has to be tested on a large number of existing clinical scans to see how well it performs on a range of different scans without user optimization or parameter tweaks.

        <description>Fuel cells are electrochemical energy conversion devices that convert the chemical energy of a
fuel (e.g., hydrogen) to electricity without combustion. Fuel cells are drawing major interest
worldwide for applications including power generation, transportation, portable electronics and
space applications. Advantages of fuel cells include their capability to operate at high
efficiencies, minimal emissions relative to internal combustion engines, low maintenance and low
operating costs. This project is concerned with solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), a promising solution
for power generation in a variety of industrial oil and gas processes, such as in petroleum refining
and natural gas processing. Unlike low'temperature fuel cells such as proton exchange
membranes (PEMs), SOFCs have the potential to operate directly on hydrocarbon fuels (e.g.,
hydrocarbon gases released as by'products of oil production) without fuel pre'processing, and
can offer unprecedented levels of efficiency when integrated with gas turbine (GT) or gasification
cycles that utilize high'temperature waste heat. SOFC producers and end'users rely on a
combination of computational modeling and experimentation for SOFC system design and
analysis to optimize performance and reliability.
Objectives and Approach
The objectives of the project are to model and experimentally characterize the electrochemical
and thermal behavior of SOFCs operated on hydrocarbon fuels. This will be achieved using
computational modeling and/or experimentation on single test cells, depending on the duratio</description>

        <description>The behaviour of the trailing vortex system behind an aircraft in close ground proximity is
dependant on the nature of the ambient wind. Local air quality considerations around major airports
mean that the dispersion of aircraft engine exhausts within the aircraft wake needs to be better

        <description>BACKGROUND:

Sustaining productivity and competitiveness in business has led to innovative responses such as providing knowledge intensive and integrated product/service solutions.  This strategic shift in the direction of a more 'servitised' business proposition is arguably one of the most significant facing manufacturers embracing the challenge of creating the basis of a distinct competitive advantage.

This new emphasis on service rather than asset delivery necessitates a fundamentally different approach to organisational configuration and coordination at a strategic level.  IVHM is a key enabler in such organisational transitions.

PROJECT AIM:

To uncover archetypal configurations of IVHM solutions in different business sectors. Sectors for initial consideration are Transport, Health, Automotive, Energy and Aerospace. For each sector a maturity spectrum illustrating various levels of IVHM capability will be generated.
 
PROJECT OBJECTIVES:
Study a broad range of industrial sectors to identify the range (basic to state-of-the-art) IVHM practice and identify future opportunities and challenges for IVHM within each sector

DELIVERABLES:
The project deliverables will be a 5 part IVHM series of professionally published executive briefings that can be used with both current and prospective IVHM Centre of Excellence partners to illustrate the different maturity levels across different sectors.

        <description>Automated Design Optimisation (multiple options)
Summary: Participation in an internal research project to automate the design optimisation
process.
The traditional method for optimising a design problem, such as the shape of an aerofoil, requires
several different software tools to be used to complete the task. This is usually an iterative process
in which several designs are considered, and the one that delivers the most acceptable set of
metrics is chosen. The output from each iteration is then used as the starting point of the next. The
problem with this approach is that it time consuming and requires substantial user intervention.
This project aims to automate the iterative process, thus reducing the need for user intervention.
The optimisation process can be considered as a workflow problem, in which several applications
must be joined together, with the output from one being fed into the input of the next. Each
application may reside on a different computational resource. A key issue in the automation of this
process is the management of workflow tasks, such as adequate control of the data transfer from
one application to the next, the handling of exceptions and the monitoring of progress of the
optimisation process. In addition, if we wish to add more applications into the workflow, or just
change the ones that are already there, we will need to find a way of doing this without having to
redesign the entire workflow.
The aim of this project is to analyse the current implementation of the workflow, and develop an
improved version. This could include:
Producing an abstract version of the workflow model
Implementing a plug-in architecture for adding and removing applications
Implementing a robust authentication methodology
Progress monitoring (runtime logs)
Provision of a debugging mechanism
Identifying a robust validation procedure

        <description>The main focus of the investigations is the adaptation of the Synthetic Aperture Focussing Technique (SAFT) for the detection of transverse flaws in welds by using phased array transducers. 
The task comprises the optimisation of the SAFT algorithm and the validation of the method on test welds. In a first step the already available SAFT software has to be adapted for the use of phased array transducers in V-transmission on welds. 
Therefore an appropriate transducer layout has to be designed. For the validation of the method test welds with artificial flaws are available. It will be necessary to design and assemble a test rig including  a manipulator and an
appropriate transducer mount. Validation measurements have to be performed.</description>

        <description>Team description:
The Structured Booking Record department is deeply involved in the ongoing migration from legacy systems (IBM mainframes) toward open environments (LINUX). It has a specific focus on the Amadeus shopping basket components and any related services (i.e. look-up functionality, publication of basket modification to interested downstream applications) 
Very stringent operational constraints in terms of transaction throughput and system availability apply.
Subject:
Background 
Each time an SBR (Amadeus Booking Record) is updated by a travel agent or a specific process, some business rules are checked to know which third-parties are interested in the actions which just occurred. In case there is a match, what we call a publication is done by the publisher to the interested third-party. 
This publication can be online/offline but is a message (EDIFACT or XML) representing a view of the SBR. All those business rules are stored in XML in a DB. XML Schemas already exist to validate these rules. 
In our case, third-parties are date warehouses, revenue integrity systems, customs etc. 
Objective 
The purpose of the internship is to study the feasibility of a generic XML rules generator. This generator could take any object as input and should be able to generate the XML rules of a given schema version. Still, the objects handled will be most of time trees with a lot of logical condition between the leaves (AND,OR, IN, Associated with) The trainee will participate in the implementation of the generator which will be used by a web GUI. This web GUI will also have to handle autentification, display and update of existing rules, track of changes, fallback of changes (i.e. handling of session). The server implementation is done in a C++ application with high constraints (concurrent DB access, ordering needed)
Required skills:
UML Design 
Curiosity in UI usability aspects

        <description>Explicit finite element (FE) simulation is used within the automotive industry for virtual development of cars. It is very important tool to evaluate the crash process and hence to improve passive safety while reducing costs of full scale prototype testing. To improve the accuracy of the full scale crash simulations, individual components can be analysed with respect to physical component tests. In our case, component testing of adhesively connected sheet metals will make the basis for comparison of different FE techniques for modelling adhesives. The purpose is to find a model which is sufficiently accurate to be used in the full scale simulations.

Work description

You will                    
· Become familiar with the modelling possibilities - theoretical study
· Make models of performed tests in ANSA (pre-processor to FE-solvers)
· Perform analyses (in LS-Dyna) and calibrate the models so that the best coincidence with the tests is achieved
· Compare different modelling techniques

Write a detailed report about the work performed. 

It may be needed to complete the test matrix with further tests. In that case thesis work students will collaborate with test engineers and perform the experiments needed. The extent of the work is deemed to be suitable for two thesis students. We would like to start the study as soon as possible.

The work will be performed at the Departments of Advanced Body Engineering and Crash Analysis at Volvo Cars in Göteborg.</description>

        <description>The internship proposed here shall quantify the predicted dynamic stability, power output, and forces on both the proposed first and second generation (20 and 100 kW) turbines. These analyses will encompass the expected environmental operating range as well as the expected operating modes and possible failure conditions. 

A sensitivity analysis will then be done to changes in design such as the number of blades, how positively buoyant the system is and the size of the buoyancy compensation modules. This analysis will allow the simulation to be used in the future as a design tool. 

Moreover, a methodology for developing Orcaflex models based on the results obtained from the Matlab simulations is intended to be developed. The developed Orcaflex models will then be used to study the deployment and recovery phases of the turbine.

A successful work to emerge from this internship would be a realistic numerical model for both the 20 and 100 kW turbines that can be easily expanded to simulate other turbine designs, predict motions for expected operating conditions and various failure modes and a tool for simplifying the Matlab simulation and porting it over to Orcaflex.

        <description>VEC simulations tools have been migrated from ANSYS to ABAQUS. Today, the whole methodology and criteria have been defined for ANSYS. The aim of the traineeship is to define methodologies and criteria for ABAQUS new reference. The first step of this stage will be to identify the main methodologies concerned by this migration. Topics such as vibration analysis (harmonic and PSD) and thermal shock will be most important cases to be taken into account. The second step will deal with a comparison between the 2 software in order to identify equivalent simulation methods and to determine the best way to translate methodologies. The third step will be focused on the translation of each methodology from ANSYS to ABAQUS. It will be very important to identify the new cards of ABAQUS similar to ANSYS code. As the software are different, it will be necessary to define new ways of methods. To validate the new methodology, it will be necessary to perform coupled simulation with the 2 software for different types of calculation. The fourth and last step will be focused on the criteria definition thanks to tests definition and results. Criteria have to be updated because results will be different. This stage will mix up: calculation software knowledge, simulation methodology, tests definition, methodology capitalization. The final objective of this traineeship will be to replace ANSYS by ABAQUS at the end. It will enable VEC FEA simulation team to be confident in this important migration. On the one hand, ABAQUS methodology has to be defined. On the other hand, these methodologies have to be deepened too and validated.</description>

        <description>SMART Technologies ULC, 18 months ago, implemented 11 core financial Oracle EBS modules, and is currently in the process of implementing the entire Oracle EBS ERP solution. There are currently 2 tracks of activity. 
 
The Tactical Projects have been kicked off - they are intended to ensure that the financial modules that we currently have implemented are working, we are utilizing the functionality to its fullest, and the foundation of the ERP is solid.
 
The Strategic plan is a 3 year plan to implement over 40 modules of Oracle including Agile, Manufacturing, asset management, etc.
 
We are in the midst of hiring full time and contract positions to help us through all of the implementations.  These positions include Oracle developers, functional, solution, and business analysts, business process analysts, project managers, technical writers and UPK developers and trainers. 
 
Smart will also be going out to tender to find a vendor of record to partner with to ensure we have the necessary knowledge and assistance going forward to successfully implement this ERP.  This vendor of record request will go out to IBM, Oracle, Accenture, Infosys - all the large international consulting firms.
 
Smart thought it would be a great opportunity to have an intern come on board to do his internship as this program would include a wide range of activities to gain real knowledge of a large multi-million dollars ERP implementation from the early stages.  Because the original implementations of Oracle EBS had its challenges, there is a wonderful opportunity for an intern to see where mistakes had been made and be part of the planning and execution of a solid ERP in a fast growing environment.
 
Intern profile:
- Good communication skills
- Management skills
- Methodical and organized
- Fluent in English
- ERP knowledge : SAP etc., Oracle EBS if possible
- Databases</description>

        <description>The Mexican plant biodiversity is mainly focused on plants living in central and southern Mexico,
and nowadays we know scarcely any about species that grow in adverse climatic conditions like
those found in the north of the country.
Moreover, in order to standardize the content of phytochemicals from a plant it is required to
know the main factors affecting the synthesis of compounds previously identified as active and
synergies that may have with other secondary metabolites.
The project is being realized by a multidisciplinary team including the chemical, biotechnology,
medical and plant biology parts. This part of the project will focus on assessing the anticancer
activity of the isolated compounds and their interaction with those generated by the plant during
stress. The intern will determine the concentration required to reduce by the 50% the viability of
breast, prostate, colon, liver and leukemia cancerous cells in vitro. After evaluating the effects of
interactions of compounds, he/she will evaluate its effects on the level of expression of genes
involved in controlling cell growth and induction of apoptosis.

        <description>A whole series of new technologies and operational concepts is under development to in-crease airspace and airport capacity to meet the growing demand of the next decades. Air-port capacity is directly linked to the longitudinal spacing and time separations between arri-vals and departures on the runway system. 

The goals of this thesis are :
· Identification of promising candidates under development to increase runway capacity,
- Estimation of their effects on longitudinal spacing and/or time separation at the runway threshold in terms of average values and stochastic distributions
- And an assessment of their maturity and possible introduction dates.

        <description>Due to recent activities on a CFRP fuselage the development of a CFRP floor structure is a logical consequence. The aim of the practical training is the support of this development mainly on the part of design work. Mr. Blairvacq will obtain the results of 2-D shell FE-calculations and shall generate appropriate CATIA models. Due to the fact that the 2-D calculation delivers only the basic outline of the parts Mr. Blairvacq (supported by his advisor) will be in charge to find the solutions for the details of the parts. Furthermore Mr. Blairvacq has to transmit the result of his work to the sizing process in order to recalculate the parts/concept if necessary. That means he will be part of the design loop. While the global sizing process is not part of the practical training, locally limited parts or areas should also be checked by FE (Nastran/Patran) or analytically by Mr. Blairvacq if it is in line with the time frame.</description>

        <description>Intragranular Full Field Strain Measurement in the Mechanical Characterization of Metallic Materials : 
The aim of the proposed training subject is to use the intragranular full field measurement techniques in order to characterize the behaviour of several metallic materials during monotonic tension loading. Such kinematic fields will be used in order to determine the material parameters of crystalline constitutive laws using inverse approach with finite element computation methods.
The materials under investigation are widely used in the automotive (single phase ferritic steel, dual phase steels) and aeronautic industries (titanium based materials).  In situ tension tests will be carried out on different materials in order to analyse the effect of (i) the crystallographic texture (in case of ferritic steel), (ii) the hard phase (martensite in case of dual phase steel), on the heterogeneity of the kinematic fields. For the titanium based materials, the aim is to analyse the effect of the twinning on the heterogeneity of the kinematic fields. Some FEM simulation with the characterized constitutive laws will be carried out in order to asses the ability of the crystalline law to reproduce the heterogeneous fields.

        <description>To develop an approach and relative results in implementing an autonomous navigation system of an indoor autonomous mobile robot employed for path following and obstacle avoidance when operates in a partially known environment. The robot is assumed to be equipped with on board
sensors, used to retrieve data to compare with a low grade 2-dimensional world model of the robot environment. Navigation could be performed by a Kalman filter used to fuse INS (Inertial Navigation System) measurements with waypoints detected along a path to be followed, to provide smoothed and continuous data.The intelligent navigation module operates, combining a path
follower algorithm with obstacle avoidance logic.The robot builds avirtual model of the surrounding environment by processing the information coming from the proximity sensors and fusing them with navigation sensor data. Following a predetermined path, while collecting more data from the on-board sensors, it will re-plan its local path in real time and manoeuvre in order to avoid any obstacles detected and navigate safely towards its destination. The algorithms developed in this study could be tested at the SWARM laboratory of the Autonomous Systems

        <description>&quot;Heat demand in residential sector is strongly correlated with the building stock structure. Each country in Europe has different characteristics and each city is the result of the accumulation of different construction waves and continuous renovation processes. The project to be developed will be focus on the research of the different characteristics of the building stocks and the main influence factors to the energy demand.

EIFER owns spatial information about the cities taking into account in this study. The work will consist in simulate parameter variations according to the specific characteristics of the buildings of each city to explain which are the main factors of the energy demand related to different construction types. Some possible variations are: orientation, material, windows percentage, isolation type, roof structure. Furthermore energy relevant socio-economical aspects have to be taken into account within the study, as for e.g. the composition of households and the related appliances level.

The influence at aggregation scales higher than buildings (neighbourhood, municipality), like for example heat canyons and heat islands, will be included in the research. The work will be based on geographical information systems (GIS) and different simulation tools developed at EIFER. Therefore the work will be developed at the &quot;Laboratory for Spatial Simulation on Energy Research&quot; (LaSSER) in EIFER, with the main activities related to Geosimulation as well as Geographic Information Science. The student should have basic GIS knowledge as well as be familiar with the ongoing discourse of the energy demand assessment of buildings.

The work will be part of the collaboration of EIFER with the London School of Economics (LSE) in London and the Politecnico di Milano. The student must be available to travel to the meetings organized at these institutions.

Fluent English is needed. Knowledge of French, German, Turkish or Italian will be appreciated.&quot;

        <description>This project will look on developing path planning algorithms. The path has to be minimal length,
subject to a stealth constraint. As the UAV has limited range, the time spent over surveying
territory should be minimized, so path length should always be a factor in the algorithm. Also, the
path should be feasible for the UAVs to follow and stay in formation. The trajectory has to meet the
speed and turn limits of the UAVs. The path-planning algorithm must also be compatible with the
cooperative behaviour envisioned for multiple UAVs. Finally, path planning algorithms are
expected to be coded in software that runs on an airborne processor. Thus, they must be
computationally efficient and real time, enabling the UAV to re-plan its trajectory if needed. The
algorithms developed in this study could be tested at the SWARM laboratory of the Autonomous
Systems Group.</description>

        <description>Previous work at Cranfield on Z-pinned I-beam specimens has demonstrated the transition from delamination failure to web failure, depending on the length of the patch and on the in-plane composite properties 1.  We now wish to carry out an equivalent study on specially prepared samples made via tufting of a suitable dry preform, followed by liquid resin infusion and cure. The manufacture of the specimens presents a real practical challenge, which is why substantial technical support will be made available by Mr Jim Hurley.

The cured specimens will be tested in tension at a (low) constant cross-head speed.  The modes of failure will be documented and related to the specimen geometry and tufting parameters (thread type, tuft-to-tuft spacing, possibly graded tufting geometry). It is intended to produce a journal publication, in collaboration with Dr J K Lander (now at the University of Bristol), comparing the behaviour observed in Z-pinned and in tufted I-sections.  Careful consideration therefore has to be given to ensuring that a suitable basis for comparison is created.

        <description>Compressedrair storage (CAES), power plants are; discussed to improve the balance, , , ,
between production and demand of electrical power e.g. from offshore wind power plants. In
case of surplus production of electrical energy, air is transported by compressors preferably
into salt caverns, while in case of electricity demand, air is released via suitably dimensioned
turbines coupled to generators for production of eiectrica! energy. Presently, there are two
types of compressed air storage plants under consideration: 'diabatic' and 'adiabatic' storage
systems. With 'diabatic' storage systems, the compression heat generated during loading the
storage is discharged into the atmosphere while during electrical power production, the air
has to be pre-heated upstream the air turbine by combustion of additional fuel, resulting in an
overall efficiency range of approx. 50%. 'Adiabatic' compressed air storage power plants use
in contrast an additional thermal storage medium achieving thus overall efficiency levels of
approx. 70%.
For ILF as designer of aboveground stations of underground storages for natural gas in salt
caverns and porous rock formations, the design of 'diabatic' and especially of 'adiabatic'
CAES power plants would represent an extension of its engineering portfolio.
Within the 'Diplomarbeit', the basic design principles and layout of compressed-air storage
power stations ('diabatic' and 'adiabatic' type) operating with salt caverns as storage
formation (ca. 500,000 m3 geometric storage volume) shall be compiled and compared on a
comprehensive basis to guide the engineering of such storages under technical and
economical aspects.
In a first step, a literature review shall be performed starting e.g. with a recent VDE study
(Energy storage in power supply systems with a high share of renewable energy sources,
dated December 2008) aiming at determining further relevant literature referring to the
design of 'diabatic' and 'adiabatic' CAES power plants operating with salt caverns as a
storage. Relevant literature shall be reviewed and the results compiled in a comprehensive
overview.
In the second step, the basic thermodynamic processes like compression, inter-stage
cooling, pre-heating and expansion in air turbines, as well as heat transfer to the heat
storage medium (in case of 'adiabatic' air storage) shall be simulated by appropriate software
available at ILF, whereby the major parameters for air compression like maximum
compression pressure and number of compression stages / inter-cooling shall be modified to
investigate the influence of these parameters under technical and economical aspects. The
main principles to optimize a compressed air storage plant shall be identified and sample
scenarios shall be created to demonstrate the influence of the main technical and
economical parameters on the operating cost of the compressed air storage. The related
calculations shall be realized based on MS-Excel including VBA routines (if required).
Finally, based on the results of the techno-economical investigations, the main components
of a 'diabatic' and of an 'adiabatic' compressed air storage (500,000 m3 geometric storage
volume) shall be specified regarding their main parameters. A flow diagram and an overview
plot plan shall be prepared for both alternatives to estimate the appropriate dimensions and
the approximate investment cost, operating cost and specific cost per stored kilowatt-hour of
the compressed air storage plant.

        <description>Projet CAD Docking Station:

Product definition evolves during product development. It must be shared with partners and suppliers who contribute to this evolution. During product development, information packages must be extracted from a configured EBOM (engineered bill of materials) database and be sent to partners and suppliers in order to allow them to perform the required work for their work packages. Ideally, these information packages, which contain CAD and possibly other types of files, should be inserted back into the original EBOM context after being modified by the partner/supplier. With today's tools, numerous technological associations do relate information objects located in a file to other objects located in other files. A simple example is a shaft diameter value in a parametric CAD file that is associated with a calculation performed in a spreadsheet. Hundreds or thousands of such associations can exist among many information packages. However, no solution is available today to systematically manage these associations between an information package and its context in order to quickly and easily break and reconcile them when necessary, while remaining under configuration control. As a consequence, the information package may be sent with information missing, and thus, the context is lost.
We propose to develop a model to provide an information package docking station that will allow efficient management of the associations that relate an information package to its EBOM context in order to facilitate product information sharing with partners and suppliers. The vision is to make it as easy to exchange an information package as it is to have a portable computer become a desktop computer, and vice-versa, through a docking station. A major challenge toward achieving this objective is to define a model of an information package and its context such that the various associations can be systematically managed. Fortunately, recent work provides the foundation for such a model that classifies various technological associations based on the nature of the knowledge embedded into an association. Based on this work, we envision being able to build a model for information management and data sharing where all the associations between an information package and its context would be transformed into sets of simpler associations, one being a transportation association. The transportation association would always sit at the interface of the information package docking station, whereas the higher-level set of knowledge associations would be either left outside or kept inside the information package, depending on the level of collaboration that is authorized with the partner or supplier.</description>

        <description>At  nuclear stations in Canada, a large number of labour hours are spent every year packing and unpacking valves.  Rings of valve-packing and their associated components (bushings, lantern rings, washers, etc.) are often extremely difficult to remove and can cause days of unplanned additional work.  These delays often occur during outages and have the potential to extend them, which can be very costly.  
New tools could be designed and manufactured to reduce the amount of work required to remove and install packing and to reduce the possibility of outage extensions due to valve-packing issues.  New tools would also allow for safer valve maintenance work, especially when repacking on valve backseats (sometimes unavoidable).
The idea of developing tooling to improve valve packing work can also be extended to valve inspection and valve repair activities.  Being able to easily and efficiently repair valve stems, for example, will save the stations time and money.
The scope of work for the project consists of assessing the nuclear station needs (meeting and brainstorming with station packing specialists and maintenance personnel), surveying the market for new ideas and existing products, outlining design requirements, purchasing, developing, designing and fabricating the tools and organizing them into a specific tool kit.
The toolkit would include inspection tools and techniques. Tools might include (but not limited to):
1. In-situ packing removal tools (can be used when valve is backseated),
2. Packing removal tools and techniques,
3. Stem repair (scores, pits, etc.),
4. Measuring devices,
5. Packing preforming tool,
The student will work under the supervision of an engineer (valve packing specialist).  The student will be associated to all aspects of this project and will be given a high-level of responsibility and autonomy.

        <description>Stress corrosion cracking (SCC) of austenitic stainless steels and Ni-based alloys operating in the 290-325°C temperature range is one of the main embrittling phenomena of structural materials used in nuclear industry. It has been recently shown that selective oxidation of Fe-Ni-Cr alloys, mainly austenitic stainless steels and 600/690 Ni-based alloys in Pressurised Water Reactor (PWR) conditions, results in local chromium depletion which is considered as the origin of crack initiation and propagation.
The aim of this project is to develop a level set based finite element model of oxidation and to apply it for the temperature dependent oxidation of Fe-Ni-Cr alloys, the ultimate goal being to derive the criteria for stress corrosion cracking initiation. Existing physical models of oxidation together with temperature and composition dependent diffusion coefficients will be implemented in order to describe the kinetics of oxide growth with a special emphasis on the chromium depleted under-layer.  
First, a simplified 1D approach will allow describing the transient oxidation during the temperature rise, finding the time necessary to reach the steady-state oxidation and directly comparing numerical results with known analytical solutions. Second, a 2D approach on a polycrystal will be developed in order to calculate oxidation induced stresses on grain boundaries. Finally, a 3D approach will be applied to calculate strain and stress maps on industrial components. 
The predictive capabilities of this model will be checked in the frame of ongoing experimental studies in our laboratory that are focused on the oxidation in PWR environment. Regular meetings with our industrial partners are planned during this project with half-a-year reports. This project can be started by a R&amp;D master study.</description>

        <description>VEC simulations tools have been migrated from ANSYS to ABAQUS. Today, the whole methodology and criteria have been defined for ANSYS. 
 
The aim of the traineeship is to define methodologies and criteria for ABAQUS new reference. 
 
The first step of this stage will be to identify the main methodologies concerned by this migration. Topics such as vibration analysis (harmonic and PSD) and thermal shock will be most important cases to be taken into account. 
 
The second step will deal with a comparison between the 2 software in order to identify equivalent simulation methods and to determine the best way to translate methodologies. 
 
The third step will be focused on the translation of each methodology from ANSYS to ABAQUS. It will be very important to identify the new cards of ABAQUS similar to ANSYS code. As the software are different, it will be necessary to define new ways of methods. To validate the new methodology, it will be necessary to perform coupled simulation with the 2 software for different types of calculation. 
 
The fourth and last step will be focused on the criteria definition thanks to tests definition and results. Criteria have to be updated because results will be different. This stage will mix up: calculation software knowledge, simulation methodology, tests definition, methodology capitalization. 
 
The final objective of this traineeship will be to replace ANSYS by ABAQUS at the end. It will enable VEC FEA simulation team to be confident in this important migration. On the one hand, ABAQUS methodology has to be defined. On the other hand, these methodologies have to be deepened too and validated.</description>

        <description>Subject: 
Fuel Conservation has become a very high priority for many airlines, and they are looking at all possible solutions to reduce fuel consumption. 
One of the main areas of research is weight control: the better you can estimate the aircraft's Zero Fuel Weight (ZFW) - the total weight without fuel -, the more accurate you can be in the calculation of the required trip fuel. 
The Flight Management application is at the heart of the subject and as an advanced load control application, it can bring substantial gain to the airlines. 
The goal of this Go-Green internship is to create a data mining application and use the collected stats on weights estimation, in order to dress airline/aircraft profiles and find out where we can improve. 
The deliveries should include a graphical user interface to display the different results.

        <description>In deciding whether a piece of text is related to a certain entity
(i.e. whether &quot;Bush&quot; relates to the President of the U.S.A., rock band
or a shrubbery), various signals are used. In order to be able to make
connections in all the World's languages, one needs to build a network
of entity names in different languages. Manually translating such a
list is impractical. The project would analyze existing information
built in Wikipedia and other sources of multilingual material to
establish a graph of entity names in different languages.</description>

        <description>Team Description:The goal of the Database Engine Teams (DBE) is to develop the databases engines components necessary to support the Fare Quote applications and to provide a set of data access APIs for Database Applications and for the cache system under Application Data Services team's responsability. This includes the responsibility to design the relational data containers. 
In addition, processes and tools/mechanisms dedicated to synchronize the different data containers/cache are designed. Finally, tools to manage, monitor and support the databases in production are also included in this component. They are developed using C, JAVA and SQL programming languages to support the two following types of activities: 
Data Update activities: A data container on Oracle relational database called Master File targeted by Database Applications, designed to facilitate data modification management 
Data fetch activities: A data container on Oracle relational database called Active Image designed to ease data retrieval

Subject:Data in the Pricing and Shopping Platform are structured into Products (i.e. type of data). Products and their dedicated processes and tools are instantiated from a predefined generic model (i.e. templates) with static queries. 
Data structures and processing are similar for all products, except few specificities and specifics columns. Standard SQL Queries will be centralized in dynamic SQL queries. SQL statements will be encapsulated into a low level Data Access API to guaranty database portability. These SQL queries will be written according to given specificities. 
The trainee will participate in studying, designing, prototyping and benchmarking a common model with dynamic SQL: 
· for a C and Java environment 
· targeting Oracle database using SQL 
· taking into account production constraints such as performance and scalability

Required skills:- Computer science, algorithmic, C/C++, JAVA, Unix, Linux. Oracle 
- Strong analytical skills. 
- Good level of English.

        <description>In case of emergency, military aircrafts are equipped with ejection seats. Before ejecting the seat, a pyrotechnic system shears the canopy in order to minimize the risks of injury for the pilot. The objective of this project is to model the separation phase of the canopy in a transient calculation to compare the initial trajectory for two different pyrotechnic systems. A suitable computation method for this application will be chosen (rigid, FEM, or reduced model) and tested. The pyrotechnic loads will be determined in cooperation with the pyrotechnic engineers, and applied to the model. Stationary aerodynamic loads will be analyzed and applied on the structure if necessary. Several calculation methods may be compared, and developments in the DASSAULT AVIATION ELFINI calculation platform may be required.</description>

        <description>Inpainting refers to the process of reconstructed deteriorated parts in paintings, images and videos. In the context of painting, a skilled artist would be in charge of this task. For digital images and videos, some methods have been recently developed to restore the corrupted parts automatically. However they still suffer from some important limitations. The goal of this internship is to to develop new inpainting algorithms that can overcome the existing limitations. 

Two situations will be particularly investigated. The first one concerns the synthesis of texture with strong structural properties (e.g. road pavement, brick wall and so on). It will be applied to various entertainment purposes like making some Google Street View images anonymous and a Photoshop plugin for general audience to clean and rectify their own pictures.

The second one focuses on face application. This task is extremely challenging and therefore, it will required to use high-level contextual information and aggregate heterogeneous information from various sensors (additional cameras, voice analysis, etc). A typical example of this second situation is the virtual removal of a microphone placed in front of a face, in real-time, during important ceremonies broadcasted on TV (music awards, presidential speech).

        <description>Deep water projects always have a lot of jumpers to be designed, fabricated and installed (50 jumpers is the typical order of magnitude on a deep water field). Past experience on such projects is also that pipelines are often susceptible to buckling and/or walking, leading in some cases to mitigation measures to be designed, fabricated and installed. Those two activities are very time consuming and as such are concentrating most of the engineering manhours of the pipeline design scope of work on a project.
The objective of this internship is to optimize analyses processes to reduce engineering manhours as well as to reduce conservatisms in the design using specific software (Isight) associated with Abaqus for performing
the finite element analysis.
Isight is used to combine cross-disciplinary models and applications together in a simulation process flow, automate their execution, explore the resulting design space, and identify the optimal design parameters subject to the required constraints. Using advanced techniques such as optimization, design for Six Sigma, approximations, and design of experiment, the student will be able to thoroughly explore the design space.

        <description>While performing load control operations for a flight departure, the planning phase is always a crucial step. Being able to forecast possible scenarios often helps taking the right decision at the right time. 
In Amadeus Load control system it is possible to individually simulate the impact of fuel, cargo, and passengers on the aircraft weight and centre of gravity. Unfortunately there is no consolidated tool allowing a &quot;global&quot; simulation. 
The goal of the internship is to design and implement such stand-alone application and then to work closely with the development teams in order to integrate is seamlessly into the current application framework.</description>

        <description>To develop an approach and relative results in implementing an autonomous navigation system of an indoor autonomous mobile robot employed for path following and obstacle avoidance when operates in a partially known environment. The robot is assumed to be equipped with onboard sensors, used to retrieve data to compare with a low grade 2-dimensional world model of the robot environment. Navigation could be
performed by a Kalman filter used to fuse INS (Inertial Navigation System) measurements with waypoints detected along a path to be followed, to provide smoothed and continuous data. The intelligent navigation module operates, combining a path follower algorithm with obstacle avoidance logic. The robot builds a virtual model of the surrounding environment by processing the information coming from the
proximity sensors and fusing them with navigation sensor data. Following a predetermined path, while collecting more data from the on
plan its local path in real time and manoeuvre in order to avoid any obstacles detected and navigate safely towards its destination.</description>

        <description>The pipeline transport of CO2 is a fundamental technology that will underpin a
large proportion of future CCS (Carbon Capture and Storage) applications.
The key problem is how to transport huge volumes of anthropogenic CO2 in a
safe and energy efficient manner from its source to its final storage point.
This has never been attempted before anywhere in the world and the scale of
the undertaking presents some key scientific challenges which need to be
resolved immediately to allow timely implementation of CCS.
The project is concerned with the use of steel pipe for the transport of CO2
and will focus on the study of crack propagation in steel pipes through
temperature gradients involving both experimental, analytical and numerical
approaches.</description>

        <description>&quot;Visual SLAM is a method that allows a UAV to build a 3D map of the world it flies over
and use this map to locate itself. The 3D data can also be used for ground collision avoidance,
object detection and to aid path planning (&quot;avoid this mountain...&quot;).
This project will investigate how features can be tracked between images in a video and how
these features can be triangulated to give an estimate of their 3D position. At the end of the
project there should be a piece of software that can construct a basic 3D map f

        <description>In an indoor environment, a vision-based tracking algorithm using single or multiple cameras fixed on the wall can estimate the target's states: position, velocity and heading. At first this study develops a single target tracking system using colour or feature detection of markers attached on the target and the nonlinear Kalman filter algorithm is applied to enhance its estimation accuracy. To extend the tracking system into multiple target case, an effective association algorithm is required. Currently the laboratory is equipped with multiple mono-cameras to track a single target, which can be used for extension to multiple target case or high-definition colour cameras can be newly implemented for this study.

        <description>The Internet of Things (IoT) describes the idea of a global network of devices, objects, and things based on today's Internet technologies. Advances in wireless sensor and actuator networks enable the realization of the IoT vision in which virtually any physical object can be connected to the internet and interact with other objects or humans. The IoT vision emerged with increased use of RFID technologies and is now expected to have considerable impact on our daily lives with applications in such important domains as logistics, retail, healthcare, transport, entertainment and many other areas of our daily lives.

At NEC Laboratories Europe (NLE) we are developing architectures, service infrastructures and applications for the Internet of Things. The successful applicant will extend NLE's IoT Java/OSGi based middleware with advanced processing capabilities and features for executing processes and services with connected real-world objects. The main focus of the work will be on the design, implementation and evaluation of middleware functionalities. We also expect the applicant to develop small applications that show how physical objects can interact with mobile phones and public displays. The student will therefore have the possibility to work with sensing and actuation technologies and should be proficient in UI programming and web technologies (REST, AJAX, etc.). The work is relevant to the IoT-A project (http://www.iot-a.eu/public) funded by the European Union in which NEC is participating.

We expect the applicant to have proficient programming skills in object-oriented languages (Java or .NET languages) and web technologies (JavaScript and REST) and an interest in software design, programming abstractions and the willingness to explore new ideas. Knowledge about business process modeling languages (BPMN and BPEL), technologies for Service Oriented Architectures, or Complex Event Processing (CEP) engines are helpful, but not required. The capability to work and contribute in a team, demonstrate good human communication skills and have good English language knowledge will be essential for a successful internship.

The NEC Laboratories Europe in Heidelberg provide an excellent working environment supporting individual creativity as well as strong teamwork.

        <description>Background.
An increasing number of surgical procedures can be replaced nowadays by minimally invasive X-ray guided procedures. Examples are the removal of obstructions in blood vessels with balloon catheters,  the embolization of aneurysms to prevent their rupture or recently even replacement of heart valves by artificial ones. The advantage for the patient is that the recovery is much faster and that some of these procedures would not have been possible with open surgery at all. The potential disadvantage is that prolonged X-ray radiation at the same spot of the skin may cause local skin damage, including hair loss. Mostly this will heal with time, but in extreme cases this may require skin surgery.
Although this risk is considered less critical than life threatening diseases of heart and vessels that can be treated this way, care should be taken to minimize this side effect. Physicians may prevent high local skin dose levels by irradiating the lesion (such as a stenosis or aneurysm) during the intervention from different directions using the angulation and rotation of the interventional X-ray C-arm. In this way the dose load is distributed over a larger part of the skin so the risk of local high dose is reduced. But then the physicians need some kind of 'skin dose map' which shows them the safest directions.
Such a skin dose map can be calculated using the parameters of the X-ray system, a patient model and knowledge about the patient position on the X-ray table. The purpose of this project is to investigate the influence of the accuracy of the patient model, the patient position and X-ray parameters on the resulting skin dose map. Also the impact of recent previous examinations using ionizing radiation (X-ray, CT, Nuclear medicin) on the skin dose map may be part of the project.

Task
The task is to study available literature and starting from a simple model to investigate the impact of the parameters mentioned above on the skin dose map. Patient models may for instance be a sphere, a cylinder, an ellipsoid or an even more accurate approximation of the real patient shape. For the X-ray parameters different filters in the X-ray beam should be taken into account. This should be modeled in Matlab. Afterwards it can be converted to C++/C# and implemented and tested on a real Xray system. The accuracy can be assessed by comparison with dosimeters or X-ray sensitive film.
At the end of the project the student should write a report and give a presentation of the results.

        <description>Tasks to accomplish (subject of the internship)
Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) are today faced with a critical problem caused by the tremendous success of mobile Internet traffic, an estimated increase of 5000% in traffic volumes over the past 3 years. The fast adoption of smart phones by consumers has indeed created a tremendous pressure on the 3G access networks that were never designed to support huge volumes of data traffic. This situation will only worsen with the provisioning of multimedia-rich services for mobile users. 
In this context, our team aims to develop solutions to seamlessly off-load 3G access networks by taking advantage of ubiquitously available WiFi networks. The objective is to smoothly divert traffic over different networking infrastructures while supporting seamless end-user mobility. The team has an advanced knowledge of multi-homing protocols with significant experience in prototyping. 
This project will be carried out in collaboration with a Dublin-based mobile Internet start up, with an objective to perfect an initial proof-of-concept that will be thereafter evolved to a carrier-grade product ready for commercialisation. 
The successful candidate interns will join an existing team of 2 software developers, and a lead project manager. The project has been underway for almost a year, and an important progress has been already achieved.

        <description>Security in Service Oriented Architectures is a major challenge in today's business applications. Although security is currently covered by standards at web-services level, security has the particularity to be spread across administrative and technological domains at different abstraction levels (Collaboration, Process, Service and Resource levels). In the scope of the research Project CESSA (http://cessa.gforge.inria.fr), we aim at enforcing security at these different levels by developing a new model of Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP). In order to support this research activity, we are searching for an ambitioned student for a 6-months internship.

The goals of the work will be to analyze solutions and develop practical examples of secure aspects which cross administrative domains and several layers of the service oriented architecture infrastructures. The student will also be able to contribute with his ideas to the team and project at each phase of the internship.

Within this internship, the student will deal with most of the following tasks:
- Familiarize with web service environments and related tools
- Develop application use cases
- Create a prototype for aspect-aware web service interfaces
- Show in proof-of-concept implementation the feasibility of new solutions

This internship is based in the SAP Labs France Research Lab, in Sophia-Antipolis. The work will be performed in the context of the Security &amp; Trust Research Practice.

        <description>The internship aims at developing a reporting framework for operational
activity on the Altéa platerform. This framework should offer support for
RSS feed, twitter-like notification, webservices for data access '

Background
Amadeus is a leading technology company in the Travel and
Tourism Industry. The Amadeus system is built around a SOA model with
services in a distributed system spread over thousands of interconnected
servers. There are around 200 software loads (major or minor) per week
on the system for the overall servers to provide evolution and bug fixes.
This Altéa platform generates 150TB of logs per weeks, which must be
analyzed and correlated into the appropriate notifications to operation and
development organizations.

Objective of the internship
The first part of the internship will be to understand the different
operational activities (monitoring, software loads ') and to analyze the
needs of the development and operational organizations to be notified of
any changes on the plateform (i.e: group submitting the new software
version wants to know when it is activated to monitor it; final users may
want to know when their new requirements (or bug fix) are ready; groups in
charge of the supporting the system want to know if a change is not
causing a disruption and would need to be reverted).

In the second part, the intern will produce a prototype framework
using the appropriate technology (Jboss, Django ') and interface it with the
main operational tools to answer some of their requirements.</description>

        <description>Background assignment:
Within Philips Research we are designing and prototyping concepts for person monitoring and lighting systems that introduces a new way of interacting with light within the home environment for safety. A number of fully working demonstrators have to be created to work with national and international partners . Demonstrators that allow for formal evaluation with experts with various backgrounds (design, behavioral psychology, business, technology) has been done. We are very interested in the results of a thorough user-based evaluation of the concept (through the demonstrator) and to optimize standards for home healthcare and safety.
 
Assignment:
The assignment for students who are capable of designing and executing demonstrators for international co-operation with  two group of partners to discover the potential of such systems to enhance safety and improve the productivity of care staff in the home and office settings. In the assignment we are primarily looking for the open-minded yet critical opinions of people towards the concept. This is a challenging task and the participants will have to be carefully selected. Also the conceptual nature of the proposition in a multi-functional setting will be an interesting challenge. The evaluation can be done with a fully working demonstrator in with our partners. It's an opportunity for you to work with state-of-the-art applications within a state-of-the-art research facility for home safety and Internet connected medical devices in the home.
An understanding of home networks such as Zigbee as Mesh networks at the location and Bluetooth for PAN is essential, and application will need to be written for mobile phones and TV systems.
 
The demonstrators' evaluation study should answer a number of questions, such as:
' Is this a system that people would like to have in their homes, and why (not)?
' Are product designers able to create the lighting effects they want easily?
'Can monitoring a product in use be unobtrusive and enhance trust.
More specifically, various aspects of the system should be addressed in the evaluation, such as:
' Appreciation safety needs of internet connected appliances in homes and offices
' Understanding of the various lighting effects that can be created to ensure safety and improve monitoring of smart systems.
' Strengths and weaknesses of the current user interaction solution
' Reason to use standards to enhance safety in home and office
' Expectations how usage of the system could change over time, as user needs are better understood.</description>

        <description>VIBRO-ACOUSTIC CHARACTERIZATION OF AUTOMOTIVE TRIM MATERIALS

While people are moving to smaller and lighter cars, they still want to keep the interior acoustics of an upper class vehicle. The interior noise levels are the result of a wide range of design parameters, such as the shape of the interior cavity, the structural design of the car body, the positioning of damping panels and acoustic trim/absorbers/insulators (carpet, headliner, materials used to cover the seats and the floor)' In order to enable and support an optimized acoustic design in an automotive context, the physics of the complex vibro-acoustic interactions and the influence of these design parameters thereon need to be better understood.

This internship fits in the context of an on-going research project lead by Toyota Motor Europe (TME) entitled 'vibro-acoustic characterization of automotive trim materials'. Within the first part of this project (2010-2011), a dedicated test setup has been designed and built which enables the accurate and full characterization of the dynamic behavior of various panels with and without acoustic treatment based on both structural and acoustic measurements. Furthermore, this setup allows the analysis of the acoustic behavior of air gaps which exist between the plate and the acoustic treatment due to (in practice often observed) bonding defects between both components. In a second phase of the project, in which the proposed internship is embedded, this setup will be used to gain an in-depth understanding of the interaction between the trim panels and the car body and its influence on the panel vibrations and noise transmission properties of automotive panels.
The internship work will be to design an experimental test campaign which will then be executed in close cooperation with TME engineers. The measurements will be performed using the newly developed test setup at TME R&amp;D center in Zaventem (Belgium). Analysis, simulation and correlation will be done.
This internship is suitable for 1 student.
Expected workload:
'             Literature : 20% 
'             Design and execution of measurement campaign : 40% 
'             Data processing : 20%
'             Simulation: 20%

        <description>Researchers in Cambridge University, in collaboration with Poclain Hydraulics, have been developing a hydraulic regenerative braking system for an articulated heavy goods vehicle.  A high-level mathematical model of the system exists and has been used to specify the hardware, however this model does not accurately account for pressure losses and inefficiencies in the system.  Therefore it is difficult to predict the performance of the hardware accurately.

This project will be concerned with developing an accurate mathematical of all of the important components in the hydraulic system so that losses and inefficiencies can be predicted.  Some experiments will be performed on the prototype hardware, in the lab and on the prototype vehicle, so as to measure important system parameters for incorporating in the model.  A set of experimental results will also be collected to validate the model.  The modeling environment will be Matlab/Simulink.

        <description>Purelink¿s software currently only allows the user to see the current positions of badges, or to see a small number of trajectories of badges over time, drawn on top of a floorplan of the building where the badges are tracked. The rendering is currently done with GDI+ and is relatively slow, precluding the drawing of a large number of badges or trajectories of badges. A first goal will be to reimplement the rendering code of Purelink¿s software to use DirectX or OpenGL to allow for high performance rendering of many graphical elements. 

A second goal, therefore, will be to implement state-of-the-art techniques from the visualization literature for showing multiple views of the data; allowing for selection, brushing and linking; and filtering. An example of recent work that combines many of these previous techniques, and that can be used as a useful example, is TripVista [Guo et al. 2011]. 

A third goal will be to design and prototype new interactive visualization techniques that are inspired by the particular properties of the spatio-temporal data. First, we will investigate new ways of allowing the user to navigate time. In particular, (1) we will prototype a time-line slider widget that allows an interval of time to be selected. In addition, (2) we will allow users to directly select a badge shown at its current location along its trajectory, and then drag the badge forward or backward along the trajectory, to navigate in time. This is inspired by DimP [Dragicevic et al., 2008], where users could navigate time by dragging elements inside a video ¿ we propose to apply this idea to the spatio-temporal data of the tracked badges. Thus, each trajectory has the potential to be used as a time-line.

We also have additional ideas for enabling users to more easily perceive and/or select subsets of data. Since displaying many trajectories at once leads to occlusion problems, one possibility is to (3) allow the user to define custom shaped brushes for performing selection, brushing, and linking. Unlike status quo brushes that are typically shaped like circles or boxes, a custom-shaped brush that is drawn on-the-fly would allow the user to more easily highlight and select trajectories of a given shape. It would also be useful to (4) allow the user to define custom ¿transfer functions¿ that compute the opacity of a trajectory based on properties of the trajectory, such as average speed. Transfer functions have previously been used in medical image and volumetric image visualization to compute the color and opacity of a 3D image as a function of density, gradient magnitude, etc. A novel use of these functions would be to apply them to spatio-temporal trajectories. For each trajectory (or each point along a trajectory), we could store the position, time, speed, and other quantities associated with the trajectory, and then allow the user to define mappings from these quantities to opacity. For example, if the user is interested in seeing data where badges are moving quickly (possibly because employees are running), the user could map high speeds to increased opacity and low speeds to zero opacity. Quantities might also be computed as a function of a reference point.

Another idea we can explore is (5) clustering trajectories of badges according to their similarity, enabling the display of summaries of many clusters, and/or the display of outliers. For example, we could seek to adapt the approach of [van Wijk and van Selow 1999], where many curves showing daily energy consumption were clustered and summarized. Such an approach could be especially useful for dealing with large numbers of trajectories or badges.

        <description>The candidate starts with a transposon mutant pot which will contain random mutations in all genes.  The first phase will be developing a screening method.  The mutants , once selected are purified and characterised genetically by sequencing the gene either side of the transposon insert.  They are also characterised physiologically in terms of their growth characteristics and biochemical properties.

Depending on how quickly the project proceeds, in phase 2, there will be possibilities to run lab scale fermenter studies to look at the expression of genes that are identified as critical to growth in beer.

This is an excellent opportunity to develop  microbiological and molecular biological laboratory techniques and possibly also to evaluate lab scale fermentations.</description>

        <description>The intern will integrate a project during the prototype testing and industrialization phase. This equipment will be the first of its kind and consists of a sampling and analysis system for the Oil and Gas testing industry. The Mechanical Engineer Intern will work under supervision of a Senior Mechanical Engineer. He will participate to the final design, manufacturing, testing, certification and industrialization of the equipment. The internship will provide the candidate with an overview of the different stages involved in qualifying a prototype for field testing and transforming a prototype into a commercial product. This project evolves in the very demanding environment of the oil and gas where the only limitations are the ones set by today's materials and technologies. Hence, it can be an opportunity for the intern to extend his knowledge in specific fields like materials, corrosion, sealing' up to the current state of the art in the oil and gas industry. There is also the possibility to work on the qualification testing of the equipment control system (the control system is used to monitor and operate a motor, several pressure and temperature sensors, a nuclear attenuation measurement system and a very accurate thermal management device). This will also be the opportunity for the intern to be part of an international team where every member contributes to the success of the project on equal basis from the nuclear physicist to the mechanic assembling the system.

        <description>Microtubules (MTs) are dynamic polar polymers assembled from heterodimers of  and  tubulin (basic MT building block). They exhibit intrinsic dynamic instability by alternating polymerization and depolymerization phases at their plus and minus ends. In eukaryote cells, MTs coordinate diverse sets of cellular processes, including cell morphogenesis, establishment of cell polarity and cell division. During cell division, MTs are arranged in a large bipolar structure, the mitotic spindle, to segregate the duplicated chromosomes. Spindle consists of several MT arrays that ensure spindle function. In particular, at the anaphase onset, the interdigitate MTs at the center of the spindle (between the two sets of duplicated chromosomes) play crucial role by controlling spindle bipolarity and spindle length and stability. These MTs overlap with an antiparallel orientation, are organized as bundles by cross-linkers of the MAP65/PRC1/Ase1 family (1, 2, 3) and are called MT midzone. During anaphase, the midzone elongates as the MTs push the spindle poles to opposite sides of the cell leading to an elongation of the mitotic spindle ¿ a process, which represents a crucial step for accurate chromosome segregation. 
Up to now our knowledge on how the cell regulates the organization and functioning of MT midzone and specifies the size of the overlapping region in a bundle remain poorly documented. To gain deeper understanding of these processes we need at first to have a better understanding of the key molecular players that control the polymerization/depolymerization properties of MTs and their lateral interactions (formation/functioning of MT bundles), and how they work together. Recent studies suggest that a simple set of proteins localizes to the midzone. One of these proteins is MAP65/PRC1/Ase1 (widely conserved crosss-linkers) that bundles selectively antiparallel MTs in vitro and that could recruit kinesins (molecular motors that slide MT past each other) and CLASP (widely conserved MT + TIP protein), (2, 3, 4). Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms by which these proteins interact to direct the size, shape and stability of the midzone remain unknown.
These studies being difficult in living cells du to the density of MT networks, the strategy we propose is to reconstitute minimal MT midzone modules in a biochemically-controlled medium (biomimetic systems). Dynamics behaviors of MTs and their associated proteins in these ¿minimal modules¿ will be observed using TIRF microscopy (Total Internal Reflexion Fluorescence microscopy), TIRFm being an elegant optical technique that allow single molecule imaging in real time (dynamics of the dynamic behavior of two proteins in the same time can be done ¿ dual view system).
To obtain spatially constrained MT architectures that mimic the two poles of a spindle from which MTs will elongate and further overlap, we recently developed micro-engineering techniques - a micro-patterning method in which MT polymerization is performed on micro-structured materials that impose geometries of assembly for MTs (Portran et al., in preparation). In this assay, stabilized MT seeds that are immobilized on the micro patterned surfaces (shape of disks) are elongated in presence of fluorescent tubulin and in the absence or presence of MT interacting proteins. With this method we were recently able to reconstitute overlapping MTs cross-linked by MAP65 that constitute the minimal protein module of the midzone. Thus, this assay system represents a first step towards an in vitro « minimal midzone » that will be further used to examine how purified proteins can work together or in opposition to dynamically organize the midzone. </description>

        <description>1. Abstract: The popularity of the Kalman filter is increasing in financial studies, notably to estimate diffusion processes. In this project, we will use it to forecast the volatility of returns and the price-earnings ratio of our products. The Kalman filter is consequently very versatile when variables, as volatility of forecast price-earnings ratio, are unobserved. The application of the Kalman filter will help the forecaster with his judgment.  An error in the model's specification may lead to a very biased prediction.
2. Missions:
- Study the data, define the different vectors (rate of productivity, stochastic volatility, ...) 
- Form the model 
- Proceed the different steps: prediction, revision, estimation
- Estimate the stochastic volatility with the Kalman filter built
- Predict the stochastic volatility
- Predict the price-earnings ratio
- Observe the results and make conclusions
3. Key words: Kalman filter, diffusion processes, financial forecasting, financial econometrics.
 
The project will last about 3 months. So I suggest that you could take on this project at the beginning and join the other project later, so that you could increase the research volume in your internship. For the Web Portal project, you won't have to carry on the immigration from Ironspeed to .Net and will principally join the development in .Net and the optimisation phase. You will need your knowledge and skills in .Net, MVC Framework, probabilistic analysis and operational research to realise these phases. Here is the outline of what you will do:
- Develop the new Portal in .net
- Proceed analysis and research to figure out the best bonus system for the site (spend reasonably - gain the most)
- Specify and implement the additional functionality required

        <description>Full Wave Form Inversion (FWI) in frequency domain is in practical use in 3D seismic applications. In 4D (or time-lapse) seismic applications, it faces some challenges that need to be analysed and studied. FWI applied to 4D seismics cases must be able to handle a broad-band in frequency and high resolution in time and space. In addition, due to the weakness of the 4D signal, it should be robustified with respect to footprint and decimation of any type, and not to have too wide a null space. The issues to be studied on synthetic datasets would be: how many frequencies to invert, how dense these frequencies must be, in what optimal sequence these frequencies should be inverted. Some possible solutions to address the footprint and noise would involve some proposed existing pre-processing of the data, existing conditioning of the update, and updating for phase or for velocity.

The intervention of the student will be,
1) sequencing of the frequencies in the update: how high, how dense, in what order (with possible looping back),
2) evaluation of the proposed existing pre-processing versus the proposed existing conditioning of the update,
3) inversion in amplitude + phase versus inversion in phase only,
4) possibly propose an optimal workflow incorporating all the issues addressed in 1,2, and 3.

The student will launch existing scripts and work on existing synthetic datasets. No programme development will be needed beyond the adaptation of already existing shells and scripts. A good sense of organisation and a good geophysical feeling would be required.

During his internship the student will have an insight into the field of seismic wave equation imaging and modelling. His work will have a direct operational impact. The student will need sufficient autonomy and sense of initiative and organization to be able to drive efficiently his project. He will work in close relationship with his supervisor

        <description>General Context

Cloud services were originally deployed over the top, in particular over
the Internet. More recently companies are deploying their own private
cloud solutions and we see a need for portability and interoperability of
public and private clouds.

We expect that brokers will become key players in such future solutions.
Historically, telecom service providers were focused on supplying
connectivity based on the VPN concept. These services have evolved to
facilitate outsourcing of advanced functionality like routing and even
security (L3 IP VPNs, security as a service, etc.).

VPN service providers started to offer dynamic access trough VPNs to their
own cloud services and also to 3rd party cloud services; e.g., the &quot;VPN
gallery service&quot; of Orange Business Services. In the future, such services
will enable dynamic mapping of cloud services over existing VPNs, hence
allowing the VPN service provider to become a broker of cloud-based
infrastructure and services. Moreover, cloud resources that are controlled
by service providers will move out of large datacenters to be located in
various other points, including telecom service providers, networking
PoPs, and even customers locations (e.g. in CPEs).

This requires a joint network/cloud architecture as well as global
optimization of resources. Indeed, the dynamism of cloud based services
cannot be really achieved without an associated dynamic control of network
resources.

Moreover, we foresee in the midterm a new generation of brokers that will
dynamically select from among various providers and orchestrate both
network and cloud services to answer dynamically specific client's
requirements.

        <description>Greenfield land is a term used to describe undeveloped land in a city or rural area. These areas of land are usually agricultural/ forest or other properties being considered for urban development. The development of such lands is called a Greenfield Development. 

In Melbourne, a number of such Greenfield Developments have installed alternative water supply systems, including what are referred to as Decentralised water systems. Decentralised water systems include approaches for stormwater harvesting, rainwater harvesting and greywater/ wastewater recycling. 

The use of such systems and technologies can allow new settlements to occur in locations which would normally be unable to be fully supported by existing water infrastructure and available water resources.

Whilst decentralised systems are often associated with a number of environmental and social benefits (i.e. reduced nutritional loads on marine and freshwater ways, etc; or reduced greenhouse gas emissions), the local ecosystem impacts are so far largely unmapped.

This student project would explore this issue in a number of steps:
1.	Choice of one or two greenfield development sites in which to explore the issue of ecological impacts from decentralised water systems in Greenfield developments
a.	Expected output: Summary of decentralised servicing systems in some of the local Greenfield developments 
2.	Literature review of the kind of ecological impacts that may occur in similar sites
a.	Expected output: brief report on the literature review
3.	Inspection of and mapping of the site(s) in terms of the ecosystems
a.	Expected output: maps with descriptions of key ecological niches on sites
4.	Stock-take of relevant species on site(s)
a.	Expected output: brief report on results of stock-take
5.	Writing a final report, and/or journal article on the results of this exercise

        <description>We would like to announce a thesis work for assessing and evaluating the launch of a DXR based Osteoporosis screening program in France. 
Both from a medical as well as from a market and legislative perspective. 
Osteoporosis is one of the most expensive and disabling diseases in the world, and mainly affect women post menopause. Medication is today low cost, but society does not know who to treat until something is already fractured and this is too late. 
Sectra has a unique technology (DXR) to assess disease very effectively together with Mammography at a very early stage and the thesis is a technical, medical, market and legislative research investigation of how such a technology can be introduced in France.</description>

        <description>The principle aim of the experiment is to measure the effect of gravity on anti-matter (in this case anti-hydrogen).

The cryo-lab is involved for two reasons:
1) the AEgIS experiment will be equipped with two superconducting magnets, which of course have to be cooled, in this case to 4.2 K. The magnets have been partially constructed and cold tested (including quenches) in the cryolab, and we have been involved in the cryostating of these items. The 5T magnet has just been put in operation in the AEgIS experimental area. The 1T magnet is now being prepared so it can be installed hopefully later this year.
2) the anti-hydrogen atoms have to be cooled to the lowest temperatures (about 100 mK) reasonably possible. To do this, we have to develop a dilution refrigerator. We have already a working dilution refrigerator in the cryolab, which is used to test materials down to the 20 mK range. The particularity of this new machine is that it has to be included in the AEgIS experiment, giving a number of constraints.

The most important part of a dilution refrigerator is its heat exchanger, used to exchange the heat between the incoming pure 3He at a temperature of about 0.8K to the outgoing 3He diluted in 4He at a temperature of about 50 mK. Once the incoming 3He is entering too warm into the mixing chamber, the dilution refrigerator will not reach its lowest temperature calculated and will for sure not be able to absorb the foreseen heat load (expressed in uW).

During your stay at the cryolab you will collaborate with a fellow on the design of this dilution refrigerator. Your main task will be the calculations on this heat exchanger (exchange surface needed, how to create this surface). After these calculations, you also have to design this heat exchanger, so it can be installed in the AEgIS experiment. The last part (could well be the longest) concerns the construction of this heat exchanger (of course with the help of the cryolab technical staff). The design and construction of this heat exchanger is a challenging task, more challenging than described in this mail!!

At the same moment you have of course to document the work you are doing such that future generations can continue to use the results of the work you have done.</description>

        <description>Background:
Enersys are a USA headquarted business and the Global leader in the supply of lead-acid batteries into Industrial Markets. Manufacturing operations are distributed globally with the UK location being in Newport ,South Wales
Enersys Newport   manufacturer lead '&quot;acid battery systems for use in Telecommunications networks, UPS systems, Military vehicles and aircraft.
All the production from the Newport facility is of a version of lead  acid technology defined as 'VRLA'(Valve Regulated Lead Acid).The VRLA technology itself is not unique to Enersys Newport and is produced in many other locations within the Enersys '&quot;including the facility in France in Arras.

Technical Outline:
Correct and reproducible functioning of the Valve(rubber compounds) in the VRLA system is critical for battery performance. It must seal against an injection moulded plastic surface to ensure air cannot enter the battery and it must open at the correct design pressure to vent any gas generated in the battery during normal operation.
The project will focus on developing with the Enersys technical team and component suppliers a greater understanding of those parameters that are influential in the function of the critical valve components.

Technical Brief:
' Project Title  'Valve functionality '&quot;key influencing parameters'
' Project Objective To work with the Enersys Technical team to detail the 'optimal' combination of valve rubber compound ,design features, mating sealing surface finish to ensure valve function reproducibility is optimised.
' Project Methodology   Detailed collation with the Enersys Technical team of the multiplicity of Valve designs in use .
With the above ,understanding of the differing test procedures used to assess valve designs.
Definition and evaluation with the Enersys team of a Global test procedure for valve testing.
With the Enersys team and valve producers  -practical work testing the interaction between differing valve designs ,valve materials and mating sealing surface finishes.
The work will be focussed in the UK in the Enersys laboratories at Newport with visits to the component manufacturers '&quot; for the valve production and the injection moulder for battery lid into which the valve seats-in England.

        <description>THEME: Storing energy in the future will continue to become more and more critical.  An alternative idea may be to build very large or very fast flywheels (roues a inertie).  There are several conflicting design constraints.  You cannot have the tip of the flywheel move at a speed higher than the speed of sound unless you are in vacuum, you must be able to hold together the heavy masses on the periphery to counter inertial forces, and you must have the gearing system to be able to connect them to generators and motors to bring them up to speed, and slow them down as you use the energy
WORK TO BE PERFORMED BY THE STUDENT :  Find literature on the subject and then formalize the problem as an optimization, to solve the appropriate problem.    You will have to model the flywheel in a finite element package, tie it to an optimizer, and find the appropriate design parameters

        <description>This internship is based in the SAP Labs France Research Lab, in Sophia-Antipolis. The work will be performed in the context of the Research Program 'Security &amp; Trust', and deals with security configuration settings, thus application or system configuration which is relevant for security, and which enforces more abstract, high-level security requirements and obligations.

Cloud computing refers to the provision of computational resources on demand via a computer network, such as applications, databases, file services, email, etc. In the traditional model of computing, both data and software are fully contained on the user's computer; in cloud computing, the user's computer may contain almost no software or data, serving as little more than a display terminal for processes occurring on a
network of computers far away.

One of the main security issue no yet addressed in cloud infrastructure is the compliance to the privacy regulations imposed by a governmental regulation office. This issue is crucial for the trust establishment between the customer that will provide his sensitive data and the cloud host. This compliance will play the role of a guarantee that the data is stored and used according to the convention and regulation imposed by the customer. Currently the cloud providers are only publishing a text description stating their privacy policy with no technical mean to verify their compliance with their statements.

At SAP we proposed a new technical approach based on sticky policies that ensure the enforcement of such privacy protection regulations by providing a control over the collected data. At any time the customer will be able to check whether his data was handled according to the declared regulation. The advantage using such technology is that although if the data is moving, the usage conditions are still accessible and enforceable.

The goal of this internship is to enhance the current sticky policy prototype and make scalable and robust enough to be deployed in the cloud.
The candidate should be an expert in Java, XML parsing, Data base management, and Web technologies.
He also should be familiar with the basic security concepts like authorizations, access control, certifications
etc '

We expect that 20% of time will be dedicated to research activities, and 80% to development.

Undergraduate students are doing these experiment and some result already have been measured.
The simulation of equivalent stress-strain curves of biaxial test based on constitutive equation of a uni axial test is performed and it compares with experimental values.
The relationship between the main factors affecting the constitutive equation and the changes in the metallurgical factor in the deformation are measureing, The dependence of stress or strain on the constants term in the constitutive equation are modified.
The simulation of deep drawing deformation based on the results will try to compare with the measured experimental values of deep drawing deformation.
The modification simulation of deep drawing deformation based on the results is performed, and it compares with an actual measurement.

        <description>-- Project presentation --
Current evolution of computer is going from independants desktops to distributed systems, called ubiquitous computing. Physical systems become more and more embedded, and more and more softwares are connected to the Internet. Based on this evolution, our team is working on smart embedded systems for smart houses, in order to provide ambiant assistance for elder people with mild demencia.

We have a long-term vision, and want our system to be scalable and easy to deploy in large scale. Open and standardized web protocols such as DPWS and Semantic Web are already providing good foundations for stable software communications. However, hardware is evolving fast, in particular embedded wireless devices. We need to build a durable solution for device communication, that would be ready to deploy on short-term, but also easy to adapt to new technologies on long-term.

-- Expected deliverables --
A deep analysis of existing technologies for pervasive computing is the first prerequisite for every other deliverables. This internship will lead to conception and implementation of a dynamic and distributed wireless system, in which devices communicate with gateways through web services. The final purpose of this project is a deployment into real environment for ambiant assistance.

        <description> 
Founded in 1926, the company takes its name from Conrad and Marcel Schlumberger, brothers who transformed the energy industry with the revolutionary idea of using electrical measurements to map subsurface rock formations. We employ over 110,000 people and work in more than 80 countries. We leverage strong local experience and the diversity in thought, background, and knowledge that more than 140 nationalities bring. 
Each day, in more than 80 countries, we help our customers find and produce oil and gas. Through our wellsite operations and in our research and engineering facilities, we are working to develop products, services and solutions that optimize customer performance in a safe and environmentally sound manner.
In 1998, Schlumberger and Framo Engineering, a Norwegian company located at Bergen, merged their expertise into a joint technology center, 3-Phase Measurements AS in order to develop and produce multiphase flowmeters. Vx technology is the latest generation of multiphase flowmeters. PhaseWatcher Vx products and PhaseTester Vx services have become the industry leaders in topside and subsea Multiphase Flow Measurement. In 2011 Schlumberger bought Framo Engineering with the vision to make Framo Engineering the worldwide subsea technology hub. In the mean time 3-Phase Measurements AS became a section of Framo Engineering called now Multiphase Metering &amp; Measurement Systems.

Multiphase Metering &amp; Measurement Systems is the Framo Engineering division for multiphase flowmeters. Our role is to create develop manufacture and maintain Vx technology. Vx technology is the core technology of our flow metering principle. It is applied and packaged for a wide variety of applications, for top side or subsea environments, at high pressure and high temperature conditions, for mobile testing units. Vx technology is sold through Schlumbergers local organizations world-wide.

        <description>DESCRIPTION

Wizcorp is an HTML5 mobile game development company; as such, we are called to store and copy larger and larger amounts of data which can be used to generate meaningful analytics data as well as to generate in-game useable data (purchase recommendations, player-versus-player auto-matching, etc).

All of Wizcorp's production uses a common platform named Mithril, which will potentially serve as a starting point for any data collection. However, a large chunk of the work will be more in regards to other datastores such as MySQL, Couchbase and ElasticSearch.

This project's aim is to create a platform which can load and digest data from our different data stores and analyze the given data with the goal of finding meaningful patterns and visually display them in a comprehensive interface. A secondary target is to create a data-processing pipeline which will create and update new in-game useable data.

GOAL


* Define and implement required logging in the Mithril platform
* Define and implement a process for data extraction from any relevant datastore available
* Define and implement a data processing architecture which will extract analytics data.
* Develop a web interface to visualize such data
* (Bonus) Define, and implement a data processing architecture which will extract in-game useable data
* (Bonus) Define, and implement a process for data reinsertion into external databases for in-game use

INTERN'S TARGET WITHIN THE PROJECT


The project should already be underway once the intern arrives in our offices. The goal of the intern is to participate in the definition and implementation of the different required components in collaboration with Wizcorp's other staff members.

The intern will be evaluated upon the progress made in terms of produced assets within the term of his internship. Depending on the duration of the internship, we expect the intern to be able to help complete between one and three of the sub-goals previously defined.</description>

Active suspensions, or suspensions of self-propelled particles such as swimming bacteria and other microorganisms, are subject to the emergence of large-scale flows and complex collective motions as a result of long-ranged hydrodynamic interactions between particles in the Stokes flow regime. These motions have been studied in detail in the past in unconfined systems [1], where they result primarily from the force dipole exerted by the particles on the fluid as they propel themselves. In strongly confined environments, such as narrow two-dimensional channels or thin liquid films, theoretical models suggest that the flow field driven by these force dipoles is screened by the boundaries and that interactions become dominated by the mass potential dipoles that a moving particle exerts on the fluid owing to its finite size [2,3]. The effect of these mass dipoles on hydrodynamic interactions in large suspensions has only received little attention, and it is unknown whether they also result in collective motions. In this study, the student will perform a literature review on previous models for hydrodynamic interactions in active suspensions and in confined spaces. He will then develop numerical simulations of these systems in two-dimensions using two approaches: first, a Lagrangian description of particle motions, in which the position and orientation of a finite number of particles particles are integrated in time and evolved according to pair potential dipole interactions; second, an Eulerian continuum model in which a kinetic equation for the conservation of a particle distribution function is integrated in time and coupled to the equations for the fluid motion. Results from both types of simulations will be analyzed and compared to previous basic models [2] and linear theories [3].

        <description>Altea Re-accommodation is the solution within Altea Inventory that enables an airline, in case of a schedule change or flight disruption, to choose the most appropriate travel alternative for the passengers affected by the change.
Our powerful solution irreversibly moves thousands of passengers every day. Any mistake from the airline analyst in the Re-accommodation strategy may lead to rebooking (all) the passengers to irrelevant travel alternatives, causing revenue loss and unsolvable recovery issues.
Within the Altea Re-accommodation Product Definition team, this challenging internship aims at designing a 'Time Machine' to enable the airline analyst to revert to initial state to review its strategy and finally replay the Re-accommodation. 
The internship may be divided into three parts:
Study and analysis of current Re-accommodation process,
Proposal of possible 'Time Machine' solutions,

        <description>During the past decade, the number of CCTV systems and the number of cameras itself within a video-surveillance system skyrocketed. Meanwhile, the number of operators in charge of the monitoring remains too low and it has been shown that most of the information retrieved is not used. Nevertheless, crowd image analysis is a key technology for public safety and control of public facilities. 

A project of Video Crowd Detection and Behavior Analysis has therefore been launched between Thales and IPAL, hosted in IPAL's premises in Singapore. The scientific challenge of this project is to design and implement algorithms enabling to automatically obtain relevant information about the movements and the collective behavior of individuals and groups within a crowded scene observed by a single camera or by a network of cameras. The ultimate goal is to be able to compute the main crowd parameters (e.g., speed, density, etc.), to understand them in terms of behaviors and to identify abnormal behaviors. This crowd behavior analysis could then be extended to other research domains of IPAL, such as pervasive environment and context-awareness using semantic models with description logic.

The project is divided in three successive tasks: Crowd Parameters Retrieval, Crowd Behaviors Recognition and Abnormal Behaviors Detection. This internship takes place in the second part of the project and its goal is to acquire an expertise in Particle Video, through the study of an existing algorithm and to adapt this algorithm to our needs (crowd analysis and trajectory clustering). A first step will be to study the existing algorithm (the article and the existing code); then a second step will be to adapt the algorithm to the crowd analysis which will lead to a third step of clustering of the particles and, as a fourth step, to evaluate the whole process. The fifth and final step will be to write a report and documentation for the library running the algorithm. 

Beside the scientific related deliverables, this project will lead to a prototype that will be run and tested on a Thales' simulation platform. These tests will enable us to validate the algorithm produced during the research works.

        <description>Air travel search consists in providing the user with travel solutions, including schedules, airlines, prices. Calculating exact prices may be costly; in some search applications that require to display a large number of prices, it may be impractical or too costly to determine actual prices, and one can rely on predicted or simulated prices. The subject of this internship is to participate in the design of an air ticket prices prediction system.

 A sound prediction system must be able to integrate market knowledge (seasonal effects, special events, competition, route-specific details, etc) that will influence demand and offer. Analysis and prediction of prices involve methods such as regression, neural networks, clustering, principal component analysis, etc.

 

After becoming familiar with the field and forecasting methods, the intern will:

- carry out a literature review (distributed databases, predictive models)

- make a prototype to implement the methods found in the literature review and test their output on realistic data. The scalability of the solution will be a key aspect of the prototype.

- write a report describing the results of the study

 

The intern will contribute to the models and the architecture that will be implemented in search and display products and will be able to test his/her methods using extensive distributed databases of real-world data. This study will be conducted in close collaboration with other team members.

 

The intern will develop skills in distributed databases and will gain exposure in exploratory data analysis, machine learning, statistical and forecasting methods.</description>

        <description>Presentation of the project

Making use of the transition towards ubiquitous environments where embedded
computing devices seamlessly integrate and cooperate to serve human needs, we can design systems specially fitted to provide care to the ageing population. At IPAL, the UbiSmart platform is being developed to help them lead an independent and purposeful life, through ambient assistive technologies. Therefore, we build smart spaces where sensors and interactive devices are deployed and reasoning algorithms implemented to gather knowledge about users' context as well as select services relevant to this context.
We are now proceeding to a test-bed with real users in a nursing home in Singapore, as well as in personal homes in France.
Our reasoning engine for context-awareness is mainly using semantic models with
description logic (see N3Logic). Due to the limitations of these rule-based approaches, such as the poor handling of uncertainty and quality of information, we are now exploring the possible integration of statistical methods to improve our results. These methods however need a prior clustering of human behaviours to operate.

Expected deliverables
This project will lead to an implementation and comparison of statical methods to cluster a dataset collected from our deployments, which will provide the opportunity to validate the research concepts described above. Besides, the student will actively participate in the deployment activities on our pilot site in Singapore.

Keywords
Ambient Assistive Living, Context-Awareness, Artificial Intelligence, Statistical Models, Clustering, Machine Learning, Ontologies.

        <description>External acoustics of helicopters is a complex task to modelize due to the strong directivity patterns of the noise sources of a rotorcraft: main rotor, tail rotor,
engine. Eurocopter tools allow the study of these complex noise sources by various means: ground measurements, in-flight measurements, main rotor
aero-acoustic modelization, on-ground noise footprints.
For noise footprint models, several codes are used depending on the needs: calculations, optimization, etc. Used codes include correction modules that
take into account a certain number of physical effects: Doppler Effect, rotor rpm variation, atmospheric attenuation, directivities.
However, for technical reasons due to the computation method (calculations in frequency band), the effects of wind is complex to implement as wind
modifies the frequency content (directivity changes) but also modifies geometrically the propagation path. Modules of &quot;ray-tracing&quot;-kind exist but are oftenly
expensive in computational time.
In this work, different wind models should be studied and implemented as a plug-in module into the various codes of footprint calculations.
The intern will have the task:
Ï to build a bibliography on existing wind models (including the simplified models)
Ï to implement one (or several) correction module(s) taking account of the wind
Ï to study the limitations and the opportunities of each wind model
For this the trainee should:
Ï become familiar with footprint noise tools (use and software architecture)
Ï integrate a (or several) wind correction modules
Ï synthesize the results in a report

        <description>Since the TSI PRM was introduced in 2008 new or redesigned trains have to have a RASTI value according to IEC 60268-16 of at least 0.5 at all areas of the train.
Since the IEC 60268-16 is a general standard on how to measure speech intelligibility, there is no specification for measurement in trains.

In the thesis the candidate sahll investigate how the requirement of the TSI PRM can be fulfilled in an economical way. Further more a comparison of the RASTI method to measure speech intelligibility with the STI-PA method should be done in the work.

In railcars as e.g. the German ICE or the Talent 2 (Bombardier) speech intelligibility measurement can be done in a &quot;closed&quot; system, where speech input( speaker microphone or digital input) and speech output (loudspeakers) is defined by the vehicle design and cannot be changed during operation. 
A special focus of the thesis should be the development of a concept for speech intelligibility measurements of signle passenger rail cars. Passenger rail cars can during operation be coupled to different vehicles as locomotives or control cars. Thus the speech input to the passenger rail car in each combination can be different. But still the requirement of the TSI PRM has to be guaranteed.

        <description>Such ultra stable emulsions can be obtained by encapsulating droplets via new methods recently developed in our laboratory.
More specifically, using a novel-silica based shell formation with simple non polar hydrocarbon oils, we have been able to encapsulate the micro droplets of an emulsion, in order to prevent coalescence and Ostwald ripening, and thus obtain an ultra stable emulsion.
However, it is not known whether or not the procedures developed will work with more complex systems (polar oils, non hydrocarbon based oils,n water droplets).
Thus, the objective of this work will be to systematically investigate the encapsulation of various types of oils and characterize the robustness of the encapsulation when it can be achieved. The encapsulated droplets will be studied with optical, fluorescent and electro microscopy techniques. The samples developed will be investigated for a potential use in the cosmetic industry.</description>

        <branche>Informatique</branche>
        <filliere>filière Systèmes et réseaux informatiques </filliere>
        <description>Summary of responsibilities

The aim of this internship is to propose and to implement a complete virtual file system providing cache functionality to work on remote data in a seamless manner. This functionality, closely link to our Software Configuration Management System, will provide locally to the developers a file system representing the sources files contained in the Source Code Repository. With few configuration parameters, the developers will be able to works on the different baseline or branches in the repository without having to checkout everything locally.


Responsibilities

Background
Amadeus is developing its own Software Configuration Management System to ease and speed up the development cycle of our products. With the project growth, some new requirements are raised to enhance our tool. One of them is to provide an easy mechanism to access specific software levels, like baseline or development branches, from each developer workstation. Speedy access is a key for the success of this tool. Some cache functions will need to be design to ensure a fast response time for all files access.

Functionality
Currently hosted on a Linux platform, our SCM repository is accessible thru different client (GUI or command line) on different O.S. (Linux, Unix and Windows). The repository itself is composed of 2 main parts, the source code repository (based on a CVS solution) and a meta data database (based on mysql) to handle all the information related to our development cycle.
The ultimate goal is to provide to our developers, a file system available on windows platform for local development (and other platforms like Linux if time permit) to display and work on the source files located inside the repository. Each action made on this file system will generate some callback in our SCM server to keep in sync the repository behind the file system and the associated meta data structure.

Objective of the internship
The internship will be part of a team of 3 persons working together on related subject link to our SCM product. He/She will have to study, propose, implement and document a complete solution in cooperation with other team members to full fill the developer¿s requirements.
One possible solution could be based on a Samba server, adjusted for our needs, working on each developer workstation providing some local resources automatically sync in background with the repository over the network.

Required skills
Deep knowledge in networking and file system management
Knowledge in Software Configuration Management 

Technologies
Java, Database, NFS (internals), Unix (Low I/O level)., Samba and related tools

        <description>Recombinant adenoviral vectors are widely used in vaccine production.  
The ?Down Stream Processing? (DSP) department at crucell develops processes for purifying and formulating (recombinant) viruses and antibodies from fermentation medium. These processes must be safe, economical and scalable. They will be implemented in a GMP production facility for the production of clinical batches and scaled-up for commercial production. A new generation of vaccines, developed by Crucell, is based on adenovirus vector technology. In DSP, the harvest process for adenovirus consists of three steps: lysis (the disruption of the cell membrane, which release the virus), DNA precipitation (to remove the DNA that is released from the cells with the virus) and finally, filtration (to remove cells, cell debris and DNA
precipitants) in order to recover the adnoviruses. Their production in mamallian cells includes a purification process which must generate a high purity virus.
The project focuses on the harvest process? last step: the purification step by membrane chromatography. The main goal will be to improve this technique as part of the process by studying the influence of the conductivity, the loading time, the feed gradient, the salt gradient and the dynamic binding capacity (DBC). Various analytical techniques will be used including HPLC methods, qPCR and any other techniques proposed from the literature study.

        <description>Making vasculature-like structures is a key component for the fabrication of functional tissue models in vitro. Recently, such structures could be formed within naturally-derived extracellular matrices (ECM), a milestone for tissue enigeneering. However, these naturally-derived hydrogels, such as collagen, show a very high batch-to-batch variability that impairs the experimental reproducibilitu. In this project, we will aim to fabricate fonctional vascular construct by growing endothelial cells into polyethylene glycol (PEG)- based matrices. The PEG matrix will be initially micro-structured to allow the specific organization of endothelial cells. Then, the physico-chemical properties of the matrix will be optimized to allow efficient vasculature formation. Finally, the nascent vascular network will be perfused and the influence of the flow rate through this network on vascularization will be assessed.</description>

        <description>Despite several attempts over nearly 30 years since HIV was identified there is still no effective vaccine. Classical viral vaccination approaches have failed when applied to HIV, due to the many barriers evolved by the virus to escape immune recognition. Nowadays the induction of HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs), as referred to their capability to recognize a wide range of primary isolates, is considered a crucial step for HIV-1 vaccine development. Indeed, a major hurdle the development of an effective vaccine is the lack of a suitable immunogen that elicits such bnAbs. The envelope glycoprotein complex (Env), which mediates virus entry and fusion to target cells, represents the solely reasonable target for neutralizing Abs mainly because it is the only accessible component on the surface of HIV-1. Considering that no cases of natural clearance are reported for HIV and the virus rapidly establishes pools that are resistant to anti-retroviral treatments, a vaccine that confers sterilizing, or close to sterilizing, immunity is needed. Major hindrances to the development of such a vaccine includes: i) the hypervariability of the virus, and thus its capability to escape antibody and T-cell responses; ii) the trimeric nature of Env, which can possibly shield vulnerable epitopes that are better exposed on the isolated monomeric subunits; iii) the flexibility and weak inter-subunit associations within the Env trimer, which can impede interactions with Abs due to denaturation, disassembly or loss of complex functionality; iv) the extensive glycosylation of Env (much of its surface is shielded by high-mannose glycans), that greatly reduces its immunogenicity.
In this project we propose to use droplet-based microfluidic systems for the directed evolution of HIV-1 Env variants. Basically, we envisage to antigenically stabilize native soluble Env trimers, meaning to select for Env trimers that feature the following properties: i) stable expression at the surface of VLPs; ii) binding with known high affinity of bnAbs; iii) absence of binding of non-neutralizing Abs. To this aim, a library of randomly mutated HIV-1 Env sequences will be generated and then screened using a droplet-based microfluidic system. Selection for enhanced complex stability and sensitivity to neutralization will be applied using a combination of already available bnAbs (positive selection), which recognize different Env epitopes as well as the ¿stability¿ of the trimeric complex, and non-neutralizing Abs (negative selection). Promising Env variants will be tested as potential immunogens in rabbits. In fact, we expect this screening to facilitate the enrichment of Env complexes with increased stability, improved homogeneity and better accessibility of neutralizing epitopes. This work is carried out in collaboration with Christoph Merten¿s Group at European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), Heidelberg, Germany and is founded by International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) Innovation Fund grant.

        <description>A small multi-cultural team responsible for providing the top K best air
transportation solutions. A transportation solution is sequence of flights
enabling the customer to go from A to B. The network is updated in
real time according to any time table change or disruption. Multi criteria
constraints like, country/airline regulations, airline preferences, passengers
connecting times, etc? are taken into account. This application runs today in
the Amadeus Cloud and is able to handle several thousand of queries per
second.

This internship gives you the opportunity to understand the Airline Business
and get a deep view of a highly scalable distributed environment where
some complex optimization logic applications run onto. Moreover, you'll
get the detailed insight of our high performance application. The project
allows you to help design and build a high performance data structure
for a large air transportation graph. You'll also have to apply the right 
algorithms to quickly find the best solutions using a multi criteria cost
function. Our current application is able to provide in several milliseconds
the top K best solutions, but, it uses a much filtered graph and limits the 
number of segments browsed from the source to the target. The aim of the
project is to use a full graph (not filtered) with all the criteria and time tableinformation. You'll help to put in place new techniques like for example
graph compression and Google transfer patterns in order to quickly return 
the best solutions on this time expanded graph. Such techniques were 
already applied on public transportation network like the Google/transit joint
project.

Data Structures, Graph Algorithms and Programming Language(C++, Java or equivalent).

Curiousness, motivation and rigorous.

ESI generally seeks outstanding individuals with a strong academic track record.  Successful candidates should be energetic, passionate about what they do and have a strong desire to learn and work in the field of scientific simulation and computer-aided engineering analysis.

Topic:  Creation of an Electro-Mechanics-Acoustics modeling module
Cross-physics interaction is becoming more and more critical in Virtual Prototyping. Companies need to make trade-offs across various specifications (for example between noise and fuel efficiency) that require a tighter integration of various domains of physics, such as fluid dynamics, acoustics, combustion, heat transfer etc.
The proposed internship aims at addressing this need from the standpoint of electrical machines (actuators, motors, loudspeaker drivers etc.) by implementing a module that will demonstrate end-to-end modeling capabilities from the electrical and mechanical input parameters to vibro-acoustic response.
The student will therefore:
- Design a prototype in collaboration with our researchers, based on one of our industrial platforms
- Define and realize at least one validation case, to be used to demonstrate the module's capabilities
- Create the related documentation material to enable further industrialization and development work

Topic:  Creation of a library of aero-acoustic (AA) and aero-vibro-acoustic (AVA) cases for validation and application
The dynamics of flow around complex objects such as automobiles, aircraft or rolling stock generates intricate pressure fields. Turbulence is associated with acoustic sources (aero-acoustics), while pressure fields interacting with elastic structures cause the structure to vibrate and to radiate noise (aero-vibro-acoustics). 
Much work has been performed over the last decades on this topic, and a wide body of knowledge, both academic and industrial, exists. However, as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and vibro-acoustic modeling techniques evolve and become more closely tied together, it is necessary to base upcoming developments on a rationalized set of validation and application cases.
The proposed internship aims at providing such a rationalized set, synthesizing the capabilities and challenges that AA and AVA modeling need to address.
As such the student will:
- Define candidate cases from bibliography
- Set up of these cases in VA One and VPS
- Create synthesis descriptions of these cases and the related theory in a 'tutorial' mode
- Document our automated QA (Quality Assurance) system for these two products

        <description>Currently, increasing effort is taken in the robotics community to understand injury mechanisms during a physical human-robot interaction. This is motivated by the fact that human and robot will work intensively and closely together, and therefore, one has to be aware of the potential threats in case such a close cooperation takes place. To gain insight into injury mechanisms during robot-human collision, impact experiments with pig tissue and crash test dummies from automobile crash testing were conducted for various contact scenarios [1, 2]. Relevant biomechanical severity indices were evaluated to quantify the injury probability for humans depending on the robot parameters, impacted body part and contact scenario.

However, impact experiments require large effort, robot parameters and contact scenarios are difficult to change instantly. The aim of this thesis is to develop an impact simulation that is able to estimate the human injury probability during a robotic impact, see Fig. 1. By simulating a wide range of robot impact masses and velocities, an injury database can be obtained that enables a robot to be aware of its potential threat to a human in every situation. Further, this information can be accessed to take appropriate countermeasures for ensuring collision safety on control level.

After reviewing relevant biomechanical literature, a multibody model of a human shall be developed. Virtual collisions against a certain human body part then provide physical quantities such as forces, torques, and deflections that can be used to evaluate biomechanical injury severity indices. The model shall be verified by comparing simulation results with experimental data obtained from biomechanical literature and robotic impact experiments.
Expected work steps

    Literature review
    Development of a human/dummy multibody model
    Evaluation of severity indices for different body parts, contact scenarios, and a certain robot mass and velocity range
    Comparison of results with experimental data from biomechanics and robotic impact experiments

Discipline: Mechanical Engineering / Chemical Engineering

Remuneration: 2500 AED monthly (tax-free), free accommodation, medical insurance and subsidized meals

Background: Industrial facilities, such as oil and gas processing plants, have critical pressure relief and flaring systems that allow a safe dispersal of highly pressurized, excess hydrocarbon vapors and liquids from production trains.  In absence of flare recovery, such streams are burnt off via flaring towers that enhance dispersal of volatile organic compounds.  It has been estimated that the equivalent of almost one third of Europe''''s natural gas consumption is burnt in flares each year worldwide.  The release of greenhouse and non-greenhouse gases into the atmosphere is associated with global warming, and significant environmental, human health and economic impacts.  Despite undergoing considerable expansion, the oil and gas industry is in the process of drastically reducing the amount of hydrocarbons flared in order to meet environmental regulations.  This involves continuous monitoring of emission levels and air quality through field measurements, as well as computational modeling to predict the spatial and temporal distribution (i.e., amount, concentration) of emissions as a function of emission source/flare system design, emission rate and stream composition, the potential presence of adjacent obstructions (e.g., buildings, terrain), meteorology, and other factors.

Key responsibilities may include (depending upon internship duration):
-Participate in on-site survey of oil/gas facility flare system, in terms of emission sources and their characteristics (i.e., source location; flare system design; emission rate, composition, and temperature)
-Participate in assessment/prediction of flare dispersal in selected oil/gas facility using computational modeling software;  comparing predictions with corresponding field measurements or reference data; Undertaking parametric analyses to evaluate the effects of selected factors on flare dispersion, such as flare system design; emission rate, composition and temperature; adjacent obstructions; and meteorology.
-Assist in the evaluation of flare/emission recovery systems for oil / gas facilities.

Qualifications: Applicants should be enrolled in either a mechanical, chemical, or energy engineering degree program at 5th year or Master''''s level, and meet the following criteria:
-Good fundamental knowledge in thermofluids (fluid mechanics, heat and mass transport, thermodynamics), 
-Computer modeling skills desirable (e.g., computational fluid dynamics (CFD), Aspen plus, Aspen Hysis),
-Strong motivation and ability to demonstrate initiative,
-Good communication skills and team player.

        <description>Summary: 

In a context of workshop capacity increase and new product industrialization, several actions need to be taken to improve the current production. The workshop will grow drastically in the next 5 years and we need to anticipate equipments layout and investment by realizing workshop simulations. New products are being commercialized in 2014 and to help supporting the production increase we need to reinforce the process by improving standard works, creating cellular manufacturing and implementing 5S standards in the new zones. Products flows and operators movements needs to be studied as well to improve the workshop efficiency and reduce waste.

Essential Responsibilities and Duties :

Take the lead in LSS projects and do followup with key stakeholders (continous improvement, 5S, '). Anticipate future production bottlenecks in the short, medium and long term (workshop simulation). Create/Update standard works to be compliant with latest standards. Create Cells for new products.     Create spaghetti diagrams, propose and implement improvement actions.

        <description>Aroma recovery in wine fermentation. Wine is a distinctive Chilean product whose quality is determined by the presence of hundreds of odorant molecules, mostly produced during wine fermentation. Release of carbon dioxide during fermentation can lead to aroma losses from wine must, resulting in degradation of the wine quality. Nowadays, wine industry is aware of aroma losses due to CO2 release, thus wine fermentation are driven at low temperatures (8ºC - 15ºC). This practice leads to several threats to the winery such as an increased risk of problematic fermentations, a significant increase of fermentation time and energy expenditure. In fact, prolonged fermentation times can reduce the effective capacity in wineries more than 30%. This study aims to design and implement -at industrial scale- a device capable of recovering the aromas that are released naturally during fermentation by CO2 stripping.


WORK TO BE PERFORMED BY THE STUDENT :  During her internship, Chloé, will execute the activities related with the implementation of the recovery device. Chloé will be responsible of the good practices of the device we are willing to implement during fermentation. After the fermentation period (april 2014) Chloé will help with the chemical and sensory analysis of the aromatic compound. The interpretation of the data will be really valuable for the project final results.

        <description>New processing devices, like multicore processors from Intel, Freescale or GPUs, signal processors and FPGAs could enable the realization of new and more complex algorithms on the one hand or  reduce hardware costs of the processors.
Performance of the software implementation depends not only on the pure processing power of the devices but as well on the communication infrastructure, real-time behaviour and the ability to distribute the algorithms on multiple cores or processing elements. Therefore benchmarking of the real application software or typical parts of the application are required to define a robust architecture.

The task is to realize, integrate and benchmark existing parts of radar signal processing application software on pre-selected processing architectures. The work will include:

·Familiarization to typical radar signal processing software architecture and modules

·Porting of the software on the already defined new processing architecture

·Test and integration of the test application

·Analysis and benchmarking of the application in terms of processing performance, communication including required processing overhead , real-time behaviour including latency and so on

·Documentation of results and additional findings</description>

        <description>Introduction : 
Zeland Refinery (ZR) operates two hydrogen Production Units (HPU) to produce the Hydrogen required for its operations. Technology of both HPU's is based on stream methane reforming (SMR)
Existing capacity of the two units : 
 - HPU-1 : 90 (kNm3/h)
 - HPU-2 : 24 (kNm3/h) (will be debottlenecked by +10% in mid 2014)
The procuded Hydrogen is routed to the Distillate Hydrocracker (DHC) unit, where it is consumed in the process of hydrotreating and hydrocarcking of VGO feedstocks.
An important byproduct of the SMR process is purgegas. Purgegas contains approx. 40-50% CO2 and also subsantial amount of H2 (PSA recovery is approx. 88-90%)
ZR and an outside company Seasun want to explore the possibility to supply - by means of pipeline - the green hous (50,000 m2) of the company.
 - A CO2 rich purge gas stream (or further purified stream) from the MR unit.
 - Low value heat, by means of a circulating hot water stream, 

Assignment: 
You are requested to study the feasability of a connection between ZR and company Seasun for the supply of CO2 rich gas and low value heat.
As part of your assigment in ZR Process Engineering department you will : 
- Study different options for CO2 supply to Seasun (unpurified purgegas stream or purified CO2 rich streams) coupled out from one of the two SMR units
- Study the impact of replacement of purgegas by Dutch Natural Gas (DNG) for firing the reformer furnace.
- Study the possibility to recover low value heat from the overhead system of the crude distillation unit, by means of hot water production (ca.95°C)
- Preliminary sizing of main equipment required for exchanges of purge gas (compressor) ad hot water (pumps, heat exchanger)
- Hydraulic calculation for the pipelines connecting ZR and Seasun (Routing assumed to be the same as the present underground oil pipeline from ZR to MOT, Seasun is located close to this pipeline route).
- Develop preliminary process flow diagrams
- Prepare estimate CAPEX requirements (+/- 40% accuracy)
- Perform preliminary IRR calculations to assess economical interest of the project
- Check impact on the refinery (EII-Energy Intensity Index) and CO2 emissions</description>

        <description>Due to engine irregularities coming from the combustion of a 6-inline cylinder engine, these components are subjected to heavy vibrations. Volvo R&amp;D is looking into possibilities to either remove, isolate, or damp these vibrations. One possibility is to isolate the highest mass from the system, which is the alternator. This can be done with the help of an OAP/OAD (overrunning alternator pulley, overrunning alternator damper).
 
The objective of the internship is to get the student up to speed with the vibration problems on Volvo belt drives, and start working on the integration of the decoupling device into the drive. It will require some discussions with suppliers, some evaluation of efficiency with the simulation department, the integration of the component with the design department, and the organization of testing. The student will also have to evaluate the fuel consumption gain due to reduction of losses from the vibration.
 
The deliveries expected for the end of the internship are the following:
- OAP/OAD benchmark
- Simulation of belt drive with OAP (done by supplier or simulation department, but organized by the student)
- Packaging check
- FMEA for OAP and update of System FMEA

        <description>Context provides fundamental information for the development of computer controlled vehicles and autonomous driving.  
Digital maps store a priori information in a structured manner to provide contextual 'cues'.  This is exploited to enhance computer-based situational awareness using sensor acquired data, and for vehicle guidance (longitudinal and lateral control) tasks.
In this internship, the enrichment of maps for autonomous driving will be addressed through the combination (fusion) between commercial navigation maps, open source maps (OpenStreetMap), and data acquired from vehicle on board sensors. This should provide an annotated map that can be used for vehicle guidance.
As part of a previous internship, a tool current in use was built to extract data on a digital map for contextualized driving assistance systems. To exploit this data in commercial navigation systems, data needs to be formatted onto an international standard, namely ADASIS V2 so information is transmitted over the vehicle can-bus. The stage will include the generation of such messages.  
Renault has considerable advance on the use of map technology for ADAS application expertise that it is exploited for autonomous driving.  Today, there is the technology to build semantic databases that can be stored in Geographic Information Systems and thus exploited with ease. The standard should explore the technologies for learning maps from a vehicle OEM perspective.

        <description>In the construction of wells to produce hydrocarbons it is required to cement casings into the well. The casings consolidate the well during its life. The placement of the casing and subsequent cementing of the casing onto the wellbore is a major activity. The cement is pumped from the surface through the casing bore before filling the annular space between the casing and the wellbore. In order to fill the annular space with cement and assure that the casing does not contain cement, the cement is pushed by another fluid called a spacer which can be extracted afterwards in the early phases of preparation for production. Furthermore in order to achieve good cementing the original fluid that is in the annular space requires to be completely removed. The casing requires to be positioned as much concentric as possible to ensure good displacement of the original fluid. 
Software exists to help the engineer design casing placement and cementing jobs, based on structural mechanics and fluid mechanics respectively. In order to help validate these software tools it is proposed to develop laboratory scale models which would enable experimental simulation of casing centralization and flow in the casing bore and annular space for various well configurations.
It is required to build a small scale test apparatus. The development of the scaling laws will rely upon dimensional analysis. The apparatus will be employed to validate software simulation tools and gain insight into the physics occurring. The apparatus will also allow demonstration of typical workflows for the cementing process. It will be required to conduct numerical simulations of centralization and flow to help guide the design of the apparatus. The numerical aspect will count 50% and is the one of the main objectives of the internship.

        <description>Aircraft operations at an airport can be decomposed in 5 major steps: - Landing on the runway. - Taxiing from runway to stand: the aircraft goes from the runway to its stand (parking position) through a network of roads called taxiway - On stand activities: disembarking and boarding of passengers and luggage, ground handling operations as catering, refueling etc? - Taxiing from stand to runway: the aircraft is pushed back from its stands and goes to the runway. - Take-off. Each step of this process involves one or several optimization problems which are studied in Amadeus. Most of these problems are addressed in a deterministic way even if many disruption events occur in real life. The goal of the internship is to help build a tool for visualizing and simulating a whole day of airport operations in order to measure performance and compare alternative optimization algorithms. In order to accomplish this development, the trainee will help build a sharp understanding of the business processes and the related optimization problems. At the end of the project, the intern will have gained business and technical knowledge of a key piece of the air traffic industry, and knowledge of the implementation of visualization and simulation solutions in an optimization context.</description>

        <description>Measurements from ultrasonic transducers are used to evaluate amongst others thickness of casing in a borehole and the quality of the cement bonding to the casing. The quality of the measurement and the ability to perform advanced interpretation on the signal received by the transducer, depends heavily on its design. Whereas ideally the transducer emits and receives only the ultrasonic wave echoing from the casing, in reality many sources of parasitic modes inside the transducer can impair the measurement. With the aid of numerical modeling and simulation we want to gain understanding of these parasitic modes and their origins, with an ultimate goal to eliminate or decrease them in order to improve the current transducer design.
   The internship mission is to build a numerical model of the current transducer design and simulate the generated wave propagation to identify sources of parasitic modes, using the commercial codes Comsol and/or Abaqus. Some particularities in this modeling are how to include correct dampening of ultrasonic waves inside the backing material that is part of the transducer, how properly include the piezoelectric ceramic-composite material which is the active part of the transducer, how to mesh the complicated geometry, how to handle the large size of the final model. The intern will be incorporated in the modeling and simulation group but will also be in close contract with the project team responsible for developing a next generation transducer. Via this interaction, modeling results should be compared and matched to experimental data provided by the project team where possible.

        <description>The BMW Group offers an interesting and varied master thesis in the field of Engineering Change Management and Data Mining. The aim is to evaluate by means of Data Mining how far it is possible to support the creation of amendments through a suggestion scheme. Background of this requirement is the ever-increasing complexity of product data management. 
To generate a professionally correct amendment on the product manufacturing process, the application creator must have transparency over different cross-relationships and impact of its changes on various vehicle components. Given the derivative growth and increasing complexity of the relations of the components (functional, geometric, systemic) with each other, this is becoming increasingly difficult.
Put simply, the system is to provide an answer as follows :

        <description>The study of material behaviour under dynamic loading covers a wide field of applications, where damage shall remain limited. Carbon-based composite materials, because of their interesting mechanical and thermal properties, along with a relatively low weight, are now increasingly used in aerospace industry. They can be essential components of satellites, where they must resist impacts of high velocity space debris. The French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) is concerned with this problem, which is similar to the protection of some equipments from high velocity debris generated in high power laser facilities such as Laser MegaJoule. Some active research is performed to study the damage and failure properties of composite materials under impact, with experimental, theoretical and numerical contributions. Indeed, thanks to the increasing capabilities of computers and hydrocodes, mesoscale simulations become now reachable, but require validated models for each component, and especially for carbon graphite.
The purpose of this training period is thus to study the damage and rupture processes of graphite under dynamic loadings.

        <description>The purpose of this internship is to design a GUI solution to view and update Amadeus Structured Booking Record (SBR) data.

Responsibilities
Background
Amadeus middleware development has put in place a HTML toolkit allowing the generation of HTML pages directly on the servers without the intermediate use of a WEB server.
These HTMP pages are automatically generated based on grammar definitions.

Objective of the training
The objective of this training is to design a solution that is well integrated into the application framework and that uses the new HTML toolkit. The trainee will need to understand the programming environment in order to extend it by adding the HTML generation and to propose a way of handling the grammars.
The SBR is quite a complex object and a complete software and graphical design is therefore needed before starting the technical design and its implementation. The first stage of the internship is to provide an SBR viewer and the second phase must allow for applying updates to a SBR object. As the update logic is complex, the full functional scope of  might be reduced depending on the advancement of the internship.
A comprehensive documentation and presentation of the result is expected.

Required skills
Knowledge of  C++ and HTML.
Object-Oriented thinking and UML.

Technologies
C++, HTML, UNIX, LINUX

Duration
4-6 month

        <description>Team Description:
The Amadeus Altéa Inventory application allows an airline to manage the distribution of its flights, the selling of space, and the delivery of related services, such as seating. 
Particularly, it enables the airline to control its inventory, i.e. provide availability and accept or deny bookings. 
The AVS team is responsible of the publication and the reception of the Availability statuses (AVS) messages. They provide up-to-date availabilities for each flight and each day to the airline partners, being another airline in codeshare or another global distribution system. 
The volume of these messages is around 20 million daily which represents a significant cost for the airlines for a utility often challenged.
Subject:
The publication of AVS messages depends on numerous settings (message format, business rule) and on numerous triggering events (booking/cancel, AVS reception, change of schedule). All these elements are impacting the volume of AVS sent for a given airlines. 
We would like to have a tool that could analyse for a given airline, the AVS traffic, the system settings and the profile of the airline in order to determine how the AVS efficiency could be enhanced. This tool will also allow us to compare the airlines o each other and propose them enhancements in their settings. 
The trainee will participate in the following activities: 
- Determination of the key indicators that characterise the profile of an airline 
- Implementation of a tool gathering AVS messages statistics and key indicators 
- Proposal to store and analyse these data in order to assess the efficiency of AVS messages

The products run on J2EE servers by distributing content providers (Amadeus and other Global Distribution Systems, Rail, hotel), the interface is web based (HTML) based on the different internal frameworks.
TMS team is the QA team validating releases and production fixes of Aetm (ETravel management).

Subject : Study and propose a solution to provide QA teams and DEV teams the possibility to manage the selection of hierarchy of communities and profiles in Production in order to manage the copy of part or totality of them on any chosen server. Different criteria of selection have to be determined and preview of pre-selection has to be considered as well. The use of production communities and profiles is critical path when we have to investigate a production issue and get the exact configuration / profiles
Once the study is finished, implement the solution and work with QA teams for validation of the solution.
As described, this subject will focus on the design and implementation of a tool to enhance and speed up production incident investigation and validation.
-------------------------------------------------------------
The corporate tool called ETravel management allows company to manage the business trip of their employees. It is highly configurable. Each company that implement it can create a hierarchy of communities with different settings. Ex: The headquarter have a certain policy that is spread to the centers in France (say Nice, Lyon., Bordeaux) which have themselves some specific local configurations/policies on the business trips. This hierarchy can be quite important and each communities is used by the employees who can have a profile to book. Some hierarchy can go up to 50 communities with 20 000 profiles.
We have currently a tool that is too simple when we need to explore the hierarchy and retrieve only specific communities or profiles. Some copies are massive and take several hours. This tool will allow through a certain number of criteria to be much more selective. When receiving an escalation of a customer to fix a hot issue, it is very important that we are able to gain time on such activity.
There is already a study on basic requirement to implement that has been created and that needs to be enriched.

Mission :
Team Description:
Amadeus is a world leader in providing IT solutions for the whole travel industry. It provides a comprehensive set of products for managing airline business from reservation to operational systems managing passengers and aircrafts at the airport. Within this set of applications, our department is in charge of the customer management and loyalty system, providing the IT tools to positively influence the customer behavior.
Learning about the customer and using this knowledge in all customer interactions is today a major trend in all industries and our activities are developing quickly. We are part of Airline IT division (running the largest data center in Europe!): this gives us access to a huge set of valuable airline customer data worldwide.
Technically, we are developing large scale applications, in fully distributed environment (SOA, clustering...), using state of the art technologies (Linux, Oracle, &quot;in memory'' databases...).
The team activities are fully integrated in &quot;agile&quot; model, including both developers and product analysts. We are also closely working with the data center teams and the marketing. This is a perfect opportunity to learn about different specialties in IT industry.
Main Responsabilities:
Purpose of the internship is to participate in integrating accurate indoor geo-localization in airline customer management applications to contextualise and personalize interactions with the traveller. Let's stop old fashion &quot;one size fits all&quot; mass advertising campaign! Airline must know what are the relevant offers, on the spot: your flight is delayed, you are stuck in terminal 4C. And suddenly on your mobile:  our apologies, please enjoy our lounge 50m on your left, just after stairs! Or we offer you a free meal at the restaurant just in front of you! To do so, we need to localize accurately the traveller...
The project details will be discussed during the interview, taking into account candidate areas of interest in the scope of customer management area: loyalty/Frequent Flyer Program, merchandizing, servicing or disruption management. Several projects using indoor geo-localization are already under study (some already mature, others more futuristic), so there is a possibility for having several trainees on this topic.
With the support of a referent engineer, the trainee will actively participate in:
  - the analysis,
  - the definition,
  - the design,
  - and the implementation of a working prototype.
The scope of the prototype will of course include the geo-localisation part, but also the full use case integration to offer a more comprehensive view of the software engineering activity, from low level technical development to the business aspects.
The team will provide full technical support on the existing platform for the end to end use case, relevant data set for experimentation and access to previous studies in this area that demonstrated the validity of this approach.
Regarding the technical environment, there is no specific prerequisite: for Amadeus standard technology, appropriate training/support will be given and we have some flexibility on the technical stack selection.

The École Supérieure de Physique et de Chimie Industrielles de la Ville de Paris (ESPCI ParisTech) is both a Grande École d'ingénieurs and a research institute (17 laboratoires) with a strong international reputation (6 Nobel Prizes). ESPCI is a highly multidisciplinary environment with teaching and research in physics, chemistry and biology.

The LCMD and LBC at ESPCI ParisTech (both between 20 and 30 pers.) are developing innovative interdisciplinary approaches to study living systems at different scales, from single-cells to tissues.

Description du projet / Project description:

The context of the project is toxicology. The project is a collaboration between 2 complementary laboratories of UMR8231, and is additionally realized in partnership with the toxicology department of a Big Pharma.

The objective of the project is to evaluate the screening of new chemical entities by measuring the induction of genes encoding cytochrome P450 isoforms in primary cultures of human hepatocytes compartmentalized in alginate microcapsules. The aim is to miniaturize the assay and thereby reduce the number of cells and the volume of other reagents required for the assay. This will allow high-throughput screening for CYP induction and increase both the number of compounds and the number of concentrations tested.

Compartmentalization in alginate capsules is a technology successfully developed at LCMD over the past 10 years. The envisioned read-out of the gene induction is a multiplexed RNA-seq approach to be developed in the project at LBC. 

The intern will participate to the following proof of concept phases:

1. Testing of hepatocyte encapsulation, viability and CYP induction in alginate capsules. 

Frozen primary hepatocytes will be thawed and encapsulated in alginate microcapsules and incubated at 37°C for at least 48 hours, with medium changed every 24 hours. Following parameters will be compared: different sized alginate capsules, different numbers of hepatocytes, presence/absence of an internal collagen layer. The time that hepatocytes can be incubated in capsules will be assessed. Viability of hepatocytes in capsules will be assayed in situ by confocal microscopy and using the Cell-Titer Blue system (Promega). Metabolic capacity of hepatocytes in capsules will be assayed by following metabolism of midazolan by LC/MS/MS.

2. Testing quantification of 4 mRNAs in hepatocytes cultured in microtitre plates using Illumina mRNA sequencing.

We will develop a method to quantify mRNA released from lysed hepatocytes based on a modified version of the Illumina TruSeq system. The mRNAs will be reverse transcribed into cDNA and two sequence-specific tags (barcodes), will be added, one on each end of the gene. The genes will then be amplified by PCR and sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq system and the barcodes used to identify the inducer and concentration used.  ESPCI will benchmark the system against QuantiGene Plex 2.0 assay.

        <description>Company

Vehicle Data Science Corporation is an Oakland, California-based startup company that makes driving safer and more efficient by establishing representative patterns from crowdsourced vehicle data. We mine logs from GPS receivers and other vehicle sensors in order to detect roadway features such as traffic signals or sharp curves, and characterize how drivers negotiate each of them. The resulting information is compiled into a map that is used by driver assistance systems to determine intervention thresholds and to build reference trajectories for automated vehicles. An overarching goal of our technology is to ?teach? self-driving cars how to act like human drivers in most situations. We are also developing risk-scoring capabilities for insurance carriers by comparing individual trips with those reference trajectories.

Internship description

This internship will specifically focus on risk-scoring analysis of vehicle trips. To that end, the intern will develop, test and evaluate metrics that match individual GPS logs to the company's existing map database, which contains a synthesis of driving characteristics. For instance, we would like to systematically compare the speed of a vehicle with that of a reference population over an entire trip. While this appears simple in concept, much care needs to be taken to only account for relevant portions of a trip -think of what happens at a traffic signal or in heavy traffic congestion.

The intern will need to initially develop a map-matching algorithm that snaps a trip onto our map, which is represented as a directed graph. Next, several approaches to scoring will need to be evaluated on a small data sample. Finally, the intern will initiate the implementation of this feature into our production system, which will require to design adequate data structures, algorithms, storage and cluster processing to ensure scalability to hundreds of gigabytes daily.

Requirements

The entire code base is programmed in Python, thus current knowledge of that language is required. Candidates should be able to speak to prior experience solving complex practical problems.

        <description>The work will be situated in the scope of Network Virtualization, and in particular Software-Defined Networks. Software-Defined Networks radically simplify the network management and introduce innovation opportunities due to the decoupling of the control plane.

However, Software-Defined Networks also come with potential overheads, and introduce new threats for robustness. In particular, a good tradeoff needs to be found between operating a system via the control software, and fast and local inband mechanisms.

We have recently started developing mechanisms that allow to introduce fast and robust failover mechanisms in the dataplane. In your project, you will implement these mechanisms in MiniNet and using a standard OpenFlow Controller Software. In addition, you are responsible for further improving and developing this technology and the algorithms.

Job description

- Implement local fast failover mechanisms in OpenFlow testbed
- Reduce complexity of these mechanisms (overhead, flow table sizes)

- Extend failover mechanisms to more general in-band functions such as Anycast or Self-adjusting mechanisms

Required skills

- Strong programming skills (Java, Python, C++)
- UNIX, Linux
- Solid algorithmic knowhow
- Willing to work independently and learn about OpenFlow

        <description>Schlumberger Vector Abbeville designs and manufactures heavy-duty winch units for oil and gas activities. A critical component of these machines is the Winch Control System (WCS). The main task of the WCS is to control an electro-hydraulic system such that it achieves the operations requested by an operator, while meeting some performance criteria (speed, torque...). Development of new control algorithms, requested by our clients (similar to ESP, ABS or cruise control in the automotive industry), calls for the use of first-class development tools, including a complex real-time simulation and test platform, that we use for Hardware In the Loop (HIL) testing. It is this test platform that requires some improvements, to better simulate specific operating conditions of our winch units. The enhancements we would like to bring are: better model of existing hardware (cable, hydraulics, mechanics), this is done using Matlab Simulink/Simscape models. Better user interface (visual aids, pictures of our systems moving as per simulated variables, maybe even add sound cues) because currently our real-time computer display is not &quot;user-friendly&quot;. Ensure that the system under test (WCS) is integrates well in the test platform.

Essential responsibilities and duties:
 Not completely defined and can vary depending on candidate preferences, but will include some or all of: programming models using Matlab/Simulink/Simscape of mechanical, and hydraulics systems. Perform wiring of HIL system with our WCS. Drafting of electrical schematics or even small electronic boards to aid with signal conditioning (matching impedances, convert TTL to 24V, etc.). Possibly: help with the design of novel control algorithms that we need for our next generation of winch units.</description>

        <description>The internship will take place in the aircraft exterior noise integration service. One of the roles of this service is to predict certification noise levels at take-off and approach conditions for aircraft in development or pre-development phases. 
To achieve this goal, exterior noise integration team disposes of an in-flight prediction tool, which is able to propagate engine and airframe noise sources up to the ground accounting for propagation effects and realistic aircraft flight trajectories. 
The first part of the internship will focus on the understanding of the discrepancies between aircraft noise measurements and in-flight noise predictions. With this aim, you will perform A350 exterior noise predictions and compare the results with noise certification flight test. 
In the second part of the internship, you will focus on the study and modelling of ground reflection effects with the objective of improving the existing model and explaining the deltas between noise measurements and predictions.
The main activities of the internship are the following:
-	Familiarization with the context: in- flight noise predictions and measurements.
-	Comparisons between A350 measurements and predictions for different flights and microphones
-	Bibliographic study on ground reflection modelling
-	Elaboration of a new ground reflection model and comparisons with the standard one
Ideally, you came from an Acoustic M2 or from an engineer school with an option in acoustic/signal processing.
For the success of the internship, knowledge in acoustics, sound propagation and aeronautics are required. 
A competence in Matlab and Fortran are also necessary. 
Moreover, a strong interest and curiosity in acoustic and aeronautics is an asset.

        <description>Creating value from the carcass is a key meat industry strategic goal. An industrial company from New-Zealand partner) has developed methods to extract high value protein streams from meaty bones. The core processes involve prolonged pressure cooking, mechanical manipulations and further heating. These processes release proteins and peptides and alter their molecular structure. This is known to impact protein and peptides functionalities. Fine-tuning of industrial parameters is often empirical, lacking a detailed understanding of the characteristics determining product quality. Thus a complete mathematical modelling framework describing and predicting cooked meat product properties based on a wide set of processing parameters will be an extremely valuable resource for the meat industry. The proposed work is issued from collaboration between a New-Zealand partner and INRA-QuaPA. The work will be conducted in three stages. A bibliography study will be performed to analyze the existing scientific knowledge which supports the existing industrial process. A new mathematical model will be developed based on the models already existing at INRA. The model will be validated, using data coming from laboratory and industrial experiments.  If there is enough time the model will finally be used to optimize the industrial process.
 

THIS PROJECT WILL TAKE PLACE AT INRA - QuaPA DEPARTMENT- 63122 SAINT GENES CHAMPANELLE - FRANCE -
and in the framework of the collaboration INRA / AgResearch Limited, some trips are planned to NewZealand.

        <description>Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) works on innovative solutions, and one of them is a Vehicle to Grid simulator.
Indeed, a part of modern challenges is reducing the emissions of GHG from the transportation field but also increasing the reliability of a grid supplied by more and more intermittent energies. 
A solution to those two problems could be found in developing electrical vehicles (EVs) that could charge or discharge on the grid.

The vehicle to grid simulator (V2G-Sim) developed provides bottom up modeling from individual vehicle dynamics all the way up to aggregate grid impacts and opportunities.

In that frame, the LBNL is developing a smart-phone application MyGreenCar that could leverage V2G-Sim to accelerate the deployment of EVs. MyGreenCar is an end-user application that will provide personalized informations and help eliminating the range anxiety of using EVs.

The proposed internship is to work on the development of MyGreenCar, but also to study the integration of solar panels production to power EVs.

        <description>Geoservices specializes in onsite extraction and analysis of gas (through process of gas chromatography) from the drilling fluid, to determine the C1-C5 composition for gas ratio analysis. With use of specific technologies, we are able to counteract cold mud returns and the contaminating effects of modern drilling fluid components.
Gas traps located at the shale shakers liberate gas from the drilling fluid. The gas is transported under vacuum via a pipe to a gas chromatograph in the mud logging unit. Flame ionization detectors (FIDs) with a fast cycle time determine the C1-C5composition. The acquisition system records the results in the database at the depth corresponding to the origin of the gas and displays them on the rig monitors and mud logs.

Currently Analytical Measurement Group (one of R&amp;D departments of Geoservices) is working on engineering of new gas analysis system (C1-C5 chromatography): introducing new detection techniques, utilizing state-of-art technologies, optimizing the system architecture, improving performance and minimizing maintenance. Improvement of chromatographic performance and optimization of chromatographic column size will be the main drivers for the internship.
The intern will need to study and understand architecture and functionality of Geoservices gas chromatograph. Conduct a market research with an objective of selecting a chromatographic column dedicated for hydrocarbons separation. The column will need to cover functionality of current GC, however has better performance and smaller footprint. Selection of new column will be based on theoretical study and laboratory experiments. The final goal will be to implement the column in prototypical gas chromatograph.
Internship may also involve participation in tests of various detectors dedicated for gas chromatography.

Objectives draft:
- Creation of project planning (Work Breakdown Structure/High Level Planning)
- Study over the existing Geoservices GC
- Market research and selection of chromatographic column
- Theoretical and empirical study on the selected columns
- Implementation of the column in prototypical GC

        <description>Short description of the company

Seedlink is a software development company focused on creating the best products and services for improving workforce quality. This ambitious goal is built on our commitment to clients, culture, and partners. We believe learning and working are inherently complimentary, especially in today's knowledge-driven economy. Yet, education and work, on a systemic level, are disconnected. Our mission is to integrate learning, assessment, and working in a simple way through innovative applications. We focus on developing applications to solve specific problems for our clients according to the following priorities:
- Efficiency and time savings
- Quality and process improvement - Profit and cost reduction

Internship description:

Recruiting qualified people quickly is a huge challenge everywhere, but it is especially labor-intensive in emerging markets. With a workforce of nearly 800 million, screening resumes in China is tedious and low-value. McKinsey reports that only 10% of Chinese professionals are fit for roles at a multinational corporation. Recruitment best practice indicates that selecting just one suitable Chinese candidate requires reviewing between 50 - 100 CVs.
In order to support our customers who want to recruit new employees, we designed and implemented RCXUE, which is a software platform for resume management and selection. RCXUE is complemented by QuestMatch, which is a dynamic assessment software that allows recruiters to interview groups of candidates digitally. Assessment is based on open-ended questions rather than survey-based assessment. This format allows greater variance of answers and deeper granularity of results. Using cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP), the answers are aggregated for comparative analysis, and candidates are automatically ranked.

Internship objective:

The candidate will support the evolution of the QuestMatch software focusing on three main directions:
- Interaction development of the software interfaces used to acquire the candidates information by Natural Language Processing.
- Data management of companies requests and candidates skills, with the twofold objective of quickly and efficiently assess the companies' needs and organize and effectively indexing the candidates information for later use by using statistic model and estimation methods.
- Definition of the data collection infrastructure and daily management of the Seedlink storage platform.</description>

        <description>The Master project is to extend the work of the strategy of ground line following using vision, implemented on quadrotors and octorotors at Heudiasyc laboratory. The used strategy regulates the forward speed of the vehicle using optical flow computed from successive images obtained by a camera pointing downward and detects lines in the images by computation of Hough transform. The objective of the project is to extend this approach to follow lines in 3D (in particular in the front direction of the UAV) by fusing multiple sensors data coming from cameras, laser, inertial measurements, ultrasonic sensors, barometers.

The first step of the project is to develop a strategy using a camera and a Hokuyo laser in order to maintain a predefined line in the field of view of a camera with a constant distance of security. The method of image-based visual servoing will be studied.

The proposed approach will have to take into account real-time constraints for experimental implementation, and also outdoor constraints such as changes in illumination, etc.

Moreover, a simulation environment for UAV (already developed at Heudiasyc laboratory) will be used to validate the proposed algorithm; prior to do real experiments.

        <description>Self-heating and spontaneous combustion of charcoal (called also bio-coal) have long been known to pose a serious problem for charcoal producers and users. This is because spontaneous combustion of charcoal can lead to loss of desirable charcoal properties and product, and raise concerns about safety, especially in charcoal storage, transportation over long distances. It is well known that the self heating of coal is mainly attributed to the complex process of low temperature oxidation

In the frame of a partnership with an international electrometallurgy group, the purpose of this study is to explain and/or predict spontaneous ignition of charcoal produced at industrial scale so as to obtain a better understanding of the role of different parameters in the low-temperature oxidation process.

The present research will focus on the influences of some intrinsic parameters including the water content, mineral matter content and volatile matter content which affect the self heating process of charcoal significantly. Others parameters like charcoal size, cooling system and the type of pyrolysis (Internal heating, external heating, heating with recirculated gas) will be approached.

To perform this study, we will use the basket method developed in the decade 80. The test index to assess the propensity for spontaneous ignition is the Spontaneous Ignition Temperature (SIT). Low-temperature oxidation kinetics can also be estimated by an energy balance approach and compared with the self-heating potential of charcoal samples.

The trainee will develop and improve the experimental system (basket method) used to determine the SIT and record the temperature history of charcoal samples. To analyze the effect of devolatilization, mineral content, etc., different analysis apparatus (proximate and ultimate analysis, BET, TGA, etc.) will be performed. The student can also propose also news experimental methods.

This laboratory investigation should help us to understand better the spontaneous combustion behavior of charcoal and provide some indications to avoid or limit it.

        <description>In Multi-Robot Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), a crucial task is the design of navigation strategies for cooperative construction and structuration of a global map based on exploration efficiency indicators. When considering vision sensors, the challenges of solving computationally efficient large-scale state estimation are much harder than using a sensor such as a laser scanner. However, in UAVs applications, cameras constitute an attractive alternative due to their compactness with limited weight and low power consumption. When using a Multi-robot architecture, formation control is a fundamental group behavior required by robot teams engaged in tasks within spatial domains. Simply speaking, formation control refers to the problem of controlling the robots such that they accomplish a specific task or reach a final objective while maintaining a collision-free flocking. For that purpose, the goal of this Master project is to investigate how to exploit the visual servoing framework and hybrid reactive control of the fleet agents for effectively controlling the pose of quadrotor UAVs equipped with an onboard camera, an IMU and embedded processing capabilities.</description>

        <description>As market leader in enterprise application software, SAP helps companies of all sizes and industries innovate through simplification. From the back office to the boardroom, warehouse to storefront, on premise to cloud, desktop to mobile device - SAP empowers people and organizations to work together more efficiently and use business insight more effectively to stay ahead of the competition. SAP applications and services enable customers to operate profitably, adapt continuously, and grow sustainably. 
SAP Product Security Research is part of the global Products and Innovation unit of SAP and is addressing the major security and trust challenges in the context of modern end-to-end business scenarios.
Product Security Research proposes a 6-month internship in its Sophia-Antipolis offices (Nice, France).
SUBJECT
The advent of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) has led to the development of multi-party web applications (MPWAs). MPWAs rely on core trusted third-party systems (e.g., payment servers, identity providers) and protocols (e.g., Cashier-as-a-Service, Single Sign-On) to deliver business services to users. Motivated by the large number of attacks discovered against MPWAs and by the lack of a single general-purpose application-agnostic technique to tackle them, in recent research, we introduce an effective black-box technique to perform attack pattern-driven security testing of MPWAs. This technique is much simpler than the ones available in the state-of-the-art and the several vulnerabilities we have been able to discover indicate that it is also effective. The work is still in progress and we cannot disclose the technical details. The implementation of our approach is based on OWASP ZAP (https://www.owasp.org/index.php/ZAP), a widely-used open-source legacy penetration testing tool.
The aim of this internship is to help in maturing this work and making it usable at SAP, so to extend dynamic analysis security testing (DAST) practice and ensure the shipment of even more secure MPWAs. In more detail, the internship student will be challenged with:
	- 	
	- 	? Understanding the SAP development process with respect to secure implementation of MPWAs
	- 	
	- 	? Understanding OWASP ZAP and similar technologies within the area of DAST
	- 	
	- 	? Contributing to the development of our testing engine and its integration with OWASP ZAP
	- 	
	- 	? Assessing our testing engine against real world (SAP and non-SAP) MPWAs
	- 	
	- 	? Documenting the developed software and the overall activities
	- 	
The student will get in touch with an industrial research surround offering concrete possibilities of migrating research outcomes into real industrial products.


We expect that 30% of time will be dedicated to research activities, and 70% to development.

        <description>Motivation 

Thermosets are typically used as electronic packaging in the automotive industry and must 

withstand high temperature changes induced from electronic chips and the environment. The 

combination with other materials, like copper for the leadframe, with different thermal 

behaviors (CTE mismatch) and a non-uniform temperature distribution leads to local stresses 

and possibly to crack initiations. This phenomenon is then called thermo-mechanical fatigue 

(TMF). Within a project the TMF of an epoxy molding compound has been addressed to 

develop a lifetime evaluation concept based on FE simulation.

Objective

The objective of the master thesis is to evaluate the validity of a lifetime model developed for 

a glass fiber reinforced thermoplastic, to adapt it or eventually to develop a new one (FE-

based). Therefore a reliable testing methodology has also to be investigated, based on an 

existing testing device (TMF-frame), which should probably be adapted for the special case 

of a thermoset.

Approach

An experimental side concerns the tensile testing of specimens with different notches at

        <description>PRESENTATION OF THE COMPANY: VOLVO GTT, Lyon
Group Trucks Technology is a worldwide entity supporting the Group Trucks and Business Area's within the Volvo Group. Group Trucks Technology¿s Scope of activities is:
- Product Planning
- Range &amp; Project Management
- Advanced Technology &amp; Research
- Complete Vehicle
- Powertrain Engineering
- Vehicle Engineering
- Purchasing
In such an organization spread across the world, our 10 000 employees are multi-brand, multi-cultural and able to work in global teams on international projects. 
FRAMEWORK
Comfort is a matter of fundamental importance for truck drivers, who are exposed to noise and vibration for quite long durations. This exposure could not only be the cause of temporary annoyance, but may also lead to long-term negative effects on the drivers' health. The knowledge of noise and vibration levels in truck cabins is therefore important for verifying the compliance of a design, identifying critical phenomena, and testing attenuation solutions.
The prediction of NVH related quantities relies more and more on virtual instead of physical testing. In this framework, Finite Element models of complete trucks are exploited in the Noise and Vehicle Dynamics team, to calculate in-cabin noise and structural vibration levels. 
 
TASKS
The main objective of the internship is the development and handling of Finite Elements models to be used in development process.
The internship activities will consist in three main axes:
 
a.Gathering of a Finite Element model of a specified vehicle, thanks to an internal Volvo tool dedicated to the assembly of complete vehicle models;
b.Calculation of structural and acoustic response to a real-life engine excitations;
c.Sensitivity analysis to identify influence of design parameters on acoustic and vibration levels.
Task a. includes a phase of learning of the numerical tools used in the Noise and Vehicle Dynamics team, and will be comparatively short-term, due to the fact that models for the components of a vehicle are already available.
Referring to task b., inputs are engine vibration forces already available for the vehicle under consideration; outputs (structural Frequency Response Functions, overall vibration and pressure levels) will be compared to measurements performed on the real vehicle.

        <description>This internship aims to determine households compositions based on TV usage analysis and to generate a profile for each of the household member describing its interests. To do so the intern will use the Electronic Program Guide (EPG) and actual TV consumption data.

EPG holds information on the programs and is often quite limited so it will first be augmented using third party information (such as IMDB or Wikipedia). An analysis of the resulting program descriptions, using natural language processing, combined with TV usage data will then aim at determining the household composition and separating the profiles of its members. 

The intern should take into account obvious privacy concerns from the start and investigate algorithms that make use of data from only one household (e.g. data does not leave the home) vs ones that use the complete dataset.

        <description>Over 90 % of cancer related death is due to the spreading of the primary tumor to distant sites. One essential characteristic for metastatic cells is enhanced motility and invasiveness. As Ca2+ signaling has been increasingly implicated in both of these processes, the research activity of our emerging group is dedicated to the study of the remodeling of calcium signaling pathways in tumor progression and metastasis formation. Our current projects focus on a highly aggressive cancer, that is melanoma, as biological model to explore and understand the roles played by mechanosensitives channels in the processes of tumor cells migration and invasion. Through established collaborations with chemists/biologists of the Ion Channel &amp; Cancer Network (IC-CGO ; http://www.ic-cgo.fr/), as well as private companies, we are also investigating the therapeutic potential of targeting this pathway using newly developed ion channels inhibitors.
During tissue invasion and metastasis formation, tumor cells have to adapt to their physical environment. One embodiment of that principle is the fact that cells need to change shape in order to migrate and squeeze through tissues or to cross endothelial barriers. Transduction of external mechanical forces into intracellular biochemical signals (mechanosensation) is crucial for the cells to take support on the extracellular matrix (ECM) and to develop traction forces to push themselves forward. These signaling events occur at the level of specialized ECM-interacting structures of the cells called Focal Adhesions (FAs). FAs signaling guides actin cytoskeleton remodeling and FAs dynamics, both being vital processes for the cell to succeed in migration/invasion. It has been shown that Ca2+-influx through stretch-activated Ca2+ channels (SAC) responding to cell membrane deformation is required for the triggering of this signaling cascade. Nevertheless, despite the identification of several SAC candidates, the molecular identity of the specific one(s) controlling tumor cell migration is still a mystery. 

Project Description:
We have recently identified a mechanosensitive channel expressed exclusively in the late stages of melanoma progression, when cells acquire a highly invasive phenotype. The candidate will be responsible to determine whether this channel constitutes a valid new theranostic biomarker for advance-stage melanoma.
These responsabilities will include :
- analyses of its expression pattern in a panel of melanoma cell lines corresponding to different stages and mutational status of the disease.
Establishment and validation of melanoma cell lines engineered to induce or repress the expression of this channel.
- Use of these cell lines and of pharmacological inhibitors to address the role of this channel in melanoma migration/invasion (Boyden chambers, in situ zymography), EMT-like switch (Q-PCR, WB), proliferation and resistance to BRAFi (MTT),… 
The selected candidate will be working in a dynamic environment and learn the use of various techniques including but not limited to cell culture, molecular biology, biochemistry, leading-edge microscopy approaches (time-lapse, confocal, calcium videomicroscopy…).&quot;

        <description>The Mobility, Vehicles, and Electricity System Research Lab (Moves-Lab) conducts R&amp;D to support the development and adoption of cleaner and more efficient vehicles, and enable the integration of these vehicles with larger infrastructure systems. Our research bridges from understanding fundamental phenomena at the powertrain sub-component level, to applying these fundamental phenomena to understand and mitigate impacts at large scales of millions of vehicles. We develop and apply simulation tools, validated by experimental measurements, to examine R&amp;D challenges from the scale of single vehicles or powertrain components, to the integration of many vehicles with infrastructure systems such as the electricity grid.
More important than simply being a collection of research areas, Moves-Lab is a collection of talented, curious, and driven people. Moves-Lab fosters learning and growth for all our team members, provides a forum for exchange of ideas, and provides a foundation for our team to make an impact on society through R&amp;D at the interfaces between mobility, vehicles, and the electricity system. While we all work to enable success in our respective project areas, we keep an open mind to new ideas and new possibilities.

        <description>Femoroacetabular impingment (FAI) is a condition that affects motion of the hip, can cause anterior hip pain, and can lead to soft tissue and cartilage degeneration at the hip.  FAI occurs in people who played elite sports during adolescence and appears to be a result of altered bone growth.  We hypothesize that the motions that occur during at-risk sports (basketball, soccer, and ice hockey) affect the growth of the bone at the hip.  In this project we will characterize the motions of the hip in young athletes using pervasive sensing technology.  This collaboration with the lab of Professor Frederic Marin (UTC) will use algorithms he has developed to calculate energetics of the motions and compare across at-risk sports (ice hockey) and athletic controls (ballet).</description>

        <description>Abstract 
High throughput in biological assays has become a focus of today's research. Cell culture is a method used for growing living cells artificially outside their natural environment under controlled conditions. It is used for a large range of applications such as studies of cellular functions, drug discovery, biotechnologies and regenerative medicine. Cell culture in vitro is generally performed on plastic substrates, especially multi-well plates or Petri dishes that are made of polystyrene, a very stiff and synthetic material. However, this stiff substrate can bias the experimental results and mask cellular responses. Indeed, these culture conditions contrast drastically with the cellular microenvironment in vivo, where the cells are surrounded by a soft extra-cellular matrix (ECM) that provides mechanical and biochemical signals. Our aim in the BioaActiveCoatings project, which is supported by the European Commission (European Research Council, Proof of Concept) is to engineer thin films made of biopolymers as coating of multiple well plates for cell culture. 
We will bring to the market these innovative surface-coated plates with a control over thickness, stiffness and presentation of bioactive molecules (peptide, growth factors) for guiding the fate of stem cells. 

Detailed internship proposal  
Layer-by-layer films are a new type of self-assembled materials, which are more and more widely used by research groups in view of their potential applications (1) and which begin to be used by industrial companies. Our team has an internationally recognized expertise in the engineering of layer-by-layer films made of biopolymers (2, 3). 
The innovative strategy of the BioaActiveCoatings project consists in using the layer-by-layer assembly of biopolymers in multi-well plates, which are compatible with biological assays and optical microscopy. The LbL-coated multi-well plates will broaden the application of cell culture plates in research and industry for fundamental biological studies, production of biological molecules, diagnosis and regenerative medicine.
The aims of the internship are: 1) to create a custom-made platform by fully exploiting the potentialities of an automated liquid handling machine to build the layer-by-layer films; 2) to characterize the as-prepared films by several physical-chemical techniques (confocal microscopy, infrared spectroscopy, profilometry and AFM) to assess their reproducibility, homogeneity and 3) to assess their bioactivity by means of biological assays on stem cells.
Location
The candidate will be working at the LMGP lab in the IMBM team in collaboration with a company developing automated liquid handling machines. For more information about the lab and team : http://www.lmgp.grenoble-inp.EN/

Profile &amp; requested skills
5th year engineering school with an interest for biomedical engineering, biotechnologies, in vitro diagnosis and tissue engineering. This internship is at the interface between engineering and life sciences. Aptitude for teamwork, good spoken and written English are requested.

        <description>Abstract 
Cytoskeletal biopolymers such as actin and tubulin are the main actors in regulating cell shape and dynamics. In turn, numerous proteins control their polymerization and stabilization at the cell membrane. The members of the ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) family insure the link between the cell cytoskeleton and the cell membrane and play a key role in a large number of physiological processes, including immune synapse formation, morphogenesis and cell motility (1) (2). Moesin is involved in the budding of viruses as well as immunological synapse formation. However, the precise molecular interactions between the ERM proteins, the plasma membrane and the cell cytoskeleton are still unknown. 
The aim of this project is to use biomimetic lipid membranes and recombinant proteins to study in well-defined environments the role of ERM proteins in an in vitro reconstituted system. 

Detailed internship proposal  
Moesin is known to switch dynamically between the cytosol, where it is in a dormant state (or inactive state), and the membrane, where it is activated (open conformation). Once activated, moesin can bind actin and tubulin filaments at its C-terminal domain. Two events are believed to induce Moesin activation: membrane binding and/or phosphorylation at specific sites. The in vivo sequence of these two events is not known. Our project aims to: 1) unravel the molecular events occurring during moesin binding to the plasma membrane; 2) understand the role of specific phosphorylation sites; 3) study the subsequent binding of cytoskeletal components 
To this end, we employ recombinant proteins (moesin, fluorescently tagged proteins, and mutant proteins mimicking the phosphorylation) as well as biomimetic membranes: large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) (3) (4) and supported lipid bilayers (SLBs).  
In the framework of this master training, we will employ supported lipid bilayers (formed by fusion of the LUVs onto a substrate) to investigate moesin/membrane interactions as well as moesin/membrane/cytoskeletal polymer interactions. The interactions at the nanometer scale will be investigated by sensitive techniques including quartz crystal microbalance, fluorescence microscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM).

        <description>This project is split in two parts.

Part one is about improving the graph visualization of collected data throughout the Wootled solutions. These visualization widgets will then be embedded in the Wootled App and website. They will form the
basis of an upcoming statistical dashboard which every Wootled user will be able to access. The skills required are mostly a very good command of Javascript and CSS.

Part two is about evaluating, designing, and implementing a Facebook app which will connect the Wootled output (mini-poll) into an end-user Facebook feed, and allow the answer of such mini-poll directly within Facebook.

As you work on these projects, you will also have to integrate parts of your libraries into the Wootled
app, and therefore be exposed to additional JS/CSS hybrid app integration projects.

You will be guided by our lead client app architect, but your autonomy will be essential in delivering a highly visible and highly valuable part of our end-consumers product.

Required skills :
-  Very good command of Javascript/CSS
-  Experience with graph visualization libraries (DC/D3/CrossFilter) is a plus
-  Experience of Backbone JS and mobile app development is a plus
-  Agile and scrum development practices
-  A good command of English

        <description>The objective of the internship is to propose an optimized lay-up for the composite upper and lower stiffened panels of the A380 Center Wing Box.

After a preliminary period of familiarization with the CWB design and stress aspects, the intern mission will be divided into 4 steps.

The first step consists in performing a sensitivity analysis of the upper panel lay-up with respect to the buckling strength, in order to define a first roughly optimized stacking sequence.

The resulting lay-up shall be adjusted, in a second step, in order to meet other sizing requirements and criteria.

Thirdly, the optimized stacking sequence pattern shall be applied and adapted to the whole cover. A Finite Element model would be used in order to compare the behaviors of the new and former covers.

Finally, with the help of the design team, a detailed and finalized stacking sequence of the complete panel (including ply drop offs and non-structural plies) shall be defined, which fulfills composite design best practices and copes with manufacturing requirements.

A technical report synthetizing the work done and the results obtained shall be realized.

The internship allows to acquire a good knowledge of composite sizing methods and tools, of Finite Element modeling of composites and of the design principles of composite parts.

This internship focuses on the following AKC (Airbus Key Competencies) :
-	Composite design and stress
-	Composite Manufacturing and Assembly

The intern will be able to discover and share team activities : analysis of CFRP structures, airworthiness regulations compliance methods, support to manufacturing units.

        <description>Objective
Define an internal policy for flexibility to be created amongst PC4 (Passenger/ Commercial Van, 4x4) plants and machines in order to ensure supplyability of demand in mid-term horizon (5 years)


Context
Tyre manufacturing is a highly constraint activity.
There are 3 main layers of constraint in production:
- 	Total plant capacity
- 	Machine capacity, in particular Tyre Assembly Machine
- 	Mold capacity

In parallel, PC4 demand is highly volatile as other Consumer Good industries.


Description
The outcome of the internship will be a set of recommendations regarding the level of flexibility to plan in the budgeting activities as well as in the medium term business plan (MTP). 

The analysis needs to take into account:
- 	Volatility of the sales plan estimated as:
o	Actual vs budget
o	Actual vs MTP of year Y-1, Y-2, Y-3, Y-4, Y-5
- 	Volatility of supply plan:
o	Actual vs budget
o	Actual vs MTP of year Y-1, Y-2, Y-3, Y-4, Y-5

The output should include but not only:
- 	An estimation of flexibility between plants:
o	% of volume that each plant should be able to transfer out in case of supply decrease or demand increase
o	% of volume that each plant should be able to bring in in case to ensure loading in case of demand decrease
- 	An estimation of flexibility between machines:
o	% of ?swings? between Tyre Assembly Machines (TAMs) in order to ensure balancing and loading of plants 
- 	An estimation of flexibility between European vs Imported production
- 	If time allows, an estimated percentage of additional molds required for top sizes in order to address volatility of top sizes
The study will be done through aggregation by plant/machine type.

In a second stage (second half of the internship), reliability of launch plan for OE (Original Equipement, meaning Car Manufacturers) will be analyzed to determine buffer required in industrialization capacity by plant. It will be addressed:
- 	Considering the changes in current launch plan vs MTP Y-1, Y-2, Y-3 and Y-4
- 	Taking into account actual trials required vs  standard used for Industrialization plan

It is proposed to measure oxygen saturation under a prosthesis when in use and try to establish ways to compare prosthetic sockets using active vacuum to sockets using passive vacuum. A fall-back solution, should this method not work, would be to use heat imaging of the residual limb to see if there are differences or combination of these methods.</description>

        <description>The main goal of this project is to develop an algorithm able to interpret the data from a LIDAR sensor in order to search for available trajectories, such that an unmanned autonomous vehicle (UAV) can achieve its goal. Available trajectories are defined as free-collisions trajectories and able to guide the UAV towards its goal position.

1)      Some related work has already been provided by a previous work. One algorithm from the related work was implemented with real data from a Lidar sensor, and it was verified that the performance of the algorithm was not suitable for real-time applications (high-processing time).


2)      The equipment available for this project is a Lidar sensor (RPLIDAR 360º) and a development board able to receive the Lidar real data. The implementation phase on a real UAV is not yet in the scope of this project. However, we intend to develop an algorithm, able to provide a trajectory for the UAV based on real-time constraints. These include the real data provided by the RPLIDAR and an output provided such that the UAV follows a free-obstacles trajectory. The output frequency depends on the algorithm complexity and must be suitable for the obstacle avoidance mission.



3)      Simulations on a 3D software (Gazebo) are essential to verify if the proposed algorithm provides a suitable trajectory to the UAV. This project is related with another one, that will provide a technique to perform as close as possible the trajectory provided by the algorithm (one project provides the algorithm, the other one provides the obstacle avoidance technique to follow the trajectory.</description>

        <description>Our product named LITECOR®, destined to the automotive industry, is composed of two thin steel sheets 

joined together with a relative thick polymer layer. Similar to high strength steels, components realized 

with LITECOR® tend to change their shape after stamping but also after thermal loading. In case of 

springback an adequate method to produce parts with the desired geometry is to use stamping tools 

which are compensated, such that the desired part geometry is obtained after springback and not 

directly after stamping. Finite Element (FE) simulation technics are appropriate to realize such a 

compensation of the tools geometry and it requires an adequate material description in order to deliver 

reliable results.

In the master thesis proposed here the springback behavior of one specific variation of the LITECOR® 

family after stamping and thermal loading will be studied in detail. The aim of this study is first to find 

out which material properties are affecting the more the simulation results and need thus to be 

described accurately (Young's modulus, flow curves, thermal expansion,...). The second aim of this work 

is to find out, within the material models available in the FE-code LS-DYNA, which is the most adequate 

and to define standard inputs for it. 

To do so hardware test results for a U-shaped profile, for a Marciniak cup (laboratory parts of our 

product development process) as well as for a roof panel are available and will be used as reference to 

validate the material model but also to compare with the model which is used today. Finally, based on 

the knowledge generated previously, an iterative study will be done in order to deduce a compensated 

geometry for the stamping tools of the roof panel.</description>

        <description>Many modern applications of machine learning, artificial intelligence and system en- gineering involve severe uncertainty: medical diagnosis, sparse preferences provided by users, system design using new and untested technologies, system dimensioning to face un- certain events such as climate change. In such cases, determining the optimal queries that will reduce the most our uncertainty and allow us to make optimal decisions is both a very important and challenging task.

A critical question when using imprecise probabilistic model, for instance in risk and reliability analysis, in decision aid or in system design, is how the uncertainty can be reduced efficiently to reach a decision, or a satisfying solution (e.g., in terms of design). A similar question has recently gained a lot of attention in preference elicitation. 

The candidate will explore how such ideas, often issued from the robust optimisation literature, can be adapted to the framework of imprecise probabilities. The goal will then be to recommend optimal questions or queries to ask to the expert. We expect the candidate to first focus on specific imprecise probabilistic models, making the elicitation easier, as well as on one-at-a- time optimisation problems, that are usually simpler to solve. The candidate will then be free to explore more complex situations, such as imprecise probabilistic models based on generic assessments or sequential optimisation problems.</description>

        <description>Epilepsy is one of the most neurological disorders that affects 0.5 - 0.8 % of the population. It is responsible of brief paroxysmal epochs, well known as seizures. These latter are caused by the abnormal hypersynchronous of one or several cerebral regions. In less than one third of the cases, epileptic seizures persist even with drug-based treatment. This is why they are called drug-resistant epilepsies. These seizures merge originally in a limited cerebral region, called Epileptogenic Zone (EZ). Therefore, a surgical solution consisting of resecting these EZ is proposed such that the epileptic seizure could be stopped with minimum of surgery side-effects. 
Several factors could result in a precise EZ resection: a robust presurgical protocol with different feedbacks involved. These latter are more or less the results of non-invasive clinical, anatomic and functional explorations. Using available observations, the goal is to identify the EZ responsible of the generation of the epileptic seizure. The organization of the EZ is assimilated to a neural network of populations relatively distributed over distant structures and responsible of the onset and the propagation of the epileptic seizure. This distributed structure complicates in some way the localisation and the characterization of the neural networks. It is noteworthy that a precise EZ resection could be contemplated using intracerebral ElectroEncephaloGraphic (iEEG) data acquired through intracranial electrodes. Indeed, although the latter iEEG data are invasive, it permits to a tiny exploration of the cerebral cortex.

The identification of the (uni/bi-directional) interactions between the different cerebral areas incorporated in the neural networks is a major issue during the presurgical phase and stands for the major objective of this project. It is enrolled particularly in the context of effective connectivity using advanced signal processing techniques towards to oriented graphs of connectivity representation. These graphs shed light upon the direct and indirect, unilateral or bilateral causal links through propagation pathways that could exist between the graph nodes. These nodes denote the cerebral regions from macroscopic point of view.

In order to infer effective connectivity, several approaches have been proposed in the literature. However all of them highlight the limits of the so-called linear methods compared to the potential of the non-linear non-parametric ones. These latter are information theory-based functions, such as transfer entropy. On the other hand, several effective causality measures have been proposed. Among them, the Granger causality in both time and frequency variants and the transfer entropy. In addition to these approaches, recent model-based methods have also been proposed using the relevant dynamic causal modelling concept.
In this internship, in a first step, different information-based approaches will be considered by evaluating their performance using realistic simulated iEEG thanks to the macroscopic computational model developed in our team. In a second step, real iEEG acquired from epileptic patients in the department of Neurology in the CHU of Rennes will be also used. Thirdly, ongoing model-based techniques will be considered and evaluated and compared to the information-based techniques.

This internship will take place in the LTSI laboratory (Laboratoire Traitement du Signal et de l'Image, Université de Rennes 1). It will permit to (i) identify both the pros. and the cons. of the considered connectivity methods in the context of drug-resistant epilepsy, (ii) retain the most adequate method by combining the obtained results with those of the clinical experts in order to improve later.

        <description>
Femoroacetabular impingment (FAI) is a condition that affects motion of the hip, can cause anterior hip pain, and can lead to soft tissue and cartilage degeneration at the hip.  FAI occurs in people who played elite sports during adolescence and appears to be a result of altered bone growth.  We hypothesize that the motions that occur during at-risk sports (basketball, soccer, and ice hockey) affect the growth of the bone at the hip.  In this project we will characterize the motions of the hip in young athletes using pervasive sensing technology.  This collaboration with the lab of Professor Frederic Marin (UTC) will use algorithms he has developed to calculate energetics of the motions and compare across at-risk sports (ice hockey) and athletic controls (ballet).</description>

        <description>General context
 
SuperGrid Institute is focused on DC grids and meshed DC grids that will supersede the AC grid in the next decades. However, key enabling technologies have to be ready before deployment of DC grid and power electronics is identified as one of them. Program 3 of SuperGrid Institute addresses power electronics for MVDC &amp; HVDC. In particular, we design DC-DC converters, medium frequency transformers and high voltage Silicon Carbide (SiC) power semiconductor devices.

 
Objectives of the internship

Market survey of high voltage DC capacitors for SiC power converters: &gt;3000V, 0.1-10mF, 5-50kHz
Study of the ageing of DC capacitors in SiC power converters (state of the art, theoretical study, experimental test)

 
Work definition

Nowadays, the power converters for railway traction and DC grid applications use metalized polypropylene film capacitors in the following range: Udc&lt;4000V, fswitch&lt;2kHz, C=0.1..10mF. SuperGrid Institute develops the new generation of power semiconductors targeting the breakdown voltage of 10kV and more. The nominal DC voltage can reach 6kV or more and the switching frequency increases dramatically up to 20kHz or more. It is necessary to realise a state of the art research and a market survey (prototypes and industrial products) of the DC capacitors with respect to the new requirements. Delivery: report including a design guide.
Thanks to the study conducted in the first point it is likely that some interesting products will be identified. Nevertheless, at present, the DC capacitors are not tested under real conditions, particularly at high switching frequencies. It is proposed to study the ageing of the capacitors in the SiC power converter environment. Delivery: report on the DC capacitors ageing methods.
As the ageing of the capacitors is a time consuming process, it is unlikely to finish all the ageing experiments during the internship. At minimum it is expected to specify and realise the test bench, and if possible, to start some experimental tests (characterisation, classical behaviour, preliminary ageing tests). Delivery: test bench specification, test plan and test report.


Collaboration

The internship will be realised in collaboration with the Ampere laboratory www.ampere-lab.fr. The internship student will work in a research group of around 20 people.

        <description>The Mobility, Vehicles, and Electricity Research Lab (Moves-Lab) is seeking talented engineers and software developers for the MyGreenCar project, which aims to accelerate the adoption of sustainable transportation using clean vehicles. Moves-Lab is part of the Grid Integration Group at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, near San Francisco, California.

About MyGreenCar:

Drivers and fleet managers are often unaware of the benefits of clean vehicles, and many are unaware whether these vehicles even meet their personal mobility needs. MyGreenCar seeks to increase the adoption of clean vehicles by enabling drivers and fleet managers to understand whether clean vehicles meet their personal needs, and quantify the magnitude of fuel and cost savings from choosing a clean vehicle. MyGreenCar provides personalized information on how clean vehicles benefit individual drivers based on their unique travel patterns, route-specific terrain and traffic conditions, and driving style. MyGreenCar collects driver mobility data and, via server-side high-fidelity vehicle powertrain models, provides rich personalized information to quantitatively show how a particular clean vehicle will benefit a driver. The MyGreenCar system consists of smartphone applications (Android/Iphone) and a server powered by the Django framework.

key words: Iphone, Android, Django, Python, PostgreSQL, data visualization, D3.js, Celery, Big data, machine learning

About Moves-Lab:

The Mobility, Vehicles, and Electricity System Research Lab (Moves-Lab) conducts R&amp;D to support the development and adoption of cleaner and more efficient vehicles, and enable the integration of these vehicles with larger infrastructure systems. Our research bridges from understanding fundamental phenomena at the powertrain sub-component level, to applying these fundamental phenomena to understand and mitigate impacts at large scales of millions of vehicles. We develop and apply simulation tools, validated by experimental measurements, to examine R&amp;D challenges from the scale of single vehicles or powertrain components, to the integration of many vehicles with infrastructure systems such as the electricity grid.


More important than simply being a collection of research areas, Moves-Lab is a collection of talented, curious, and driven people. Moves-Lab fosters learning and growth for all our team members, provides a forum for exchange of ideas, and provides a foundation for our team to make an impact on society through R&amp;D at the interfaces between mobility, vehicles, and the electricity system. While we all work to enable success in our respective project areas, we keep an open mind to new ideas and new possibilities.

        <description>Le projet suivant est un exemple de ce qui pourra être fait : 
&quot;The first line of defence against infection is the immune system. The innate immune system is composed of several sensors that can detect molecules, such as nucleic acids, from microbes and subsequently engage a response to clear the infection. However, in some cases, these sensors can detect self-molecules and engage in sterile inflammation. We have recently shown that self-nucleic acid detection can be engaged by enzymatic DNA recombination (with the bacteriophage CRE recombinase). Since CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing leads to direct breaks of the DNA, we hypothesise that this technology can also engage immune responses. The project of Ms Boursinhac will be addressing this hypothesis with the following experimental plan (relying on several variations of genome editing technologies).

        <description>BT is operating the UK's nationwide IP network consisting of thousands of interconnected network devices. These device produce status and failure events and provide performance metrics as time series data. In addition to the network data BT also records data about the performance of its services like broadband and IP TV.  All of this data is recorded in BT's big data infrastructure resulting in several TB of data per month. 
It is a challenge for network operation centres and customer experience assurance to identify the right signals in this data to diagnose network problems and it is even more challenging to use this data to prevent network elements from failing. 
The objective of this project is to combine the network event and performance data from the network with network topology information and data about service performance in order to detect anomalies and predict failures and service outages. The project will focus on developing a proof of concept that demonstrates a scenario on how predictive analytics can make use of this big data and develop insight that network operation centres can act upon.

        <description>Knowledge management is always a challenge in a big company like Amadeus. Employees have to deal daily with hundreds of concepts and business-specific acronyms, and it can be difficult to find the meaning of a word, or the best expert for a given topic. The foundations of an automatic knowledge extraction engine, based on state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, is being developed to help in this problematic.
The trainee will join a dynamic team in the Central Reservation System and participate in the exploration and implementation of new functionalities for this engine, such as team activity recognition, advanced expert finding, acronym sense disambiguation and others.
She/he will help the team to improve and optimize the existing back-end architecture developed in Python to allow knowledge extraction from new sources of data, and tune the machine learning algorithms to make the results more relevant. She/he will also participate in improving the web-based user interface to ensure diverse types of interactions and feedback between users and the knowledge engine. </description>

        <description>The main project is to provide effective user-adaptive support for Multi-Modal Document (MMD) processing. For that, we need to build a user model that will track relevant properties of the user necessary for ascertaining when and where to provide adaptive support in processing the visualization embedded in the MMD, and to identify forms of adaptive highlighting interventions on the MMD visualizations that are effective and nonintrusive for the user.

It will be necessary to conduct user studies to collect eye-tracking data that can be analyzed to gain an initial understanding of how users process MMDs, and how the processing is influenced by user characteristics such as personality traits and cognitive abilities. We will explore whether this eye-tracking data can be used to detect in real time the target user's characteristics. We will also leverage the data to design user-adaptive interventions that can support each user's visualization processing 

The intern will: help run user studies for data collection;  experiment with various machine learning approaches in order to improve accuracy and do predictions at the user level.</description>

        <description>Recommendation systems seek to predict the rating or preference that a user would give to an item. The most popular approach used in recommender systems is the collaborative filtering. In this approach, systems recommend items based on similarity measures between users and/or items. The items recommended to a user are those preferred by similar users. However, the ratings are often very sparse or inexistent for the new users/or items (cold start problem), causing collaborative filtering methods to degrade significantly in their recommendation performance. Recent work showed that a deep learning step can lead to a better representation for the content information, an then to better quality of recommendation.
The objective of this internship is to implement and evaluate the existing
recommendation techniques that combine collaborative filtering and deep learning, starting with the work of Wang et al. published in KDD 2015.</description>

Sujet :
To study the behavior of fission products (FP) in nuclear fuels during a Severe Accident (SA), thermal treatments under controlled atmosphere are performed on irradiated fuels and SIMFUEL samples. Complementary to irradiated fuels studies, the use of SIMFUEL makes it possible to investigate FPs speciation by means of powerful techniques (i.e. X-ray absorption spectroscopy). The conventional way to fabricate SIMFUEL does not allow volatile FPs to remain in the UO2 matrix as they are released during the sintering process (1650°C, 2h). Recently UO2 SIMFUEL samples containing volatile FP such as cesium and iodine have been synthesized thanks to Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS, 1000°C, 5 min). 
The objective of the proposed work is to better understand the phenomena taking place during the sintering of these systems, in order to achieve samples with densities and microstructures that are representative of real spent fuel, to be used for further analysis at CEA and JRC. The work will consist of a propaedeutic literature review coupled with experiments to be conducted at JRC.  First the sintering behavior of the pure phases (UO2 and the additives) will be studied separately, then, the behavior of binary and ternary systems (UO2 + Cs/Mo/Ba etc.) will be investigated. The effect of different processing parameters, such as ball milling time, feed powder stoichiometry, sintering temperature and time on the final microstructure (porosity, grain size, homogeneity of the distribution of the additives) will be studied. Once a better understanding of the process will be achieved, the final Simfuels of the desired compositions will fabricated and shipped to CEA for final characterization.

        <description>Nowadays the future of oil and gas industry is in pending: which quantities are left? Should we search deeper? How can we perform that? Which technologies should be used? 
Within this context, the qualification of technologies and materials used for buoyancy in ultra-deep sea application (more than 3000m) is of a great importance. It is why a common research program has been set between TOTAL, the world's fourth- largest oil and gas company, and IFREMER, the French marine institute.  This project is mainly based on a material dedicated to buoyancy application; the syntactic foam. A better understanding of the damages mechanisms of this key material is essential. This project includes characterization, understanding and prediction of the long terms behavior under hydrostatic pressure to simulate the depth. 
The training offer is based on this project. The trainee will perform and interpret mechanical characterization of syntactic foams under high hydrostatic pressure. He (or she) will have a crucial role to evaluate influencing parameters such as nature of the matrix, Tg value, temperature of the test. He (or she) will participate in the development and set up of new insitu characterization of buoyancy loss over long period, which is one of the breaking point in our understanding for this study. Finally based on results obtained in this program a prediction will be developed using modelling with the aim to predict the long term behavior of such material.

        <description>Play the City uses gaming to engage multiple stakeholders in resolving complex urban challenges.
Changing the way we engage stakeholders, Play the City designs physical games as a method for collaborative decision making and conflict resolution. We tailor our games according to the questions of our clients. These can relate to large urban projects, refugee camps, violence prevention and other multi-stakeholder challenges societies face.

We use gaming as a problem-solving method bringing top down decision makers together with bottom up stakeholders. In the accessible environment of games, freed from the jargons, various ideas, plans and projects meet, conflict and collaborate towards negotiated outcomes.
We believe gaming is the real alternative to standard formats of public consultation in the 21st century. Our method has been acknowledged internationally and has been implemented for large-scale projects in Amsterdam, Istanbul, Brussels and Cape Town.

Dynamic urban development ?is? the 21st century. As master planning falls out of favor, city makers are calling for more effective and collaborative methods. We, Play the City, consult governments and companies through our physical Gaming method. A game is a model, a simplified version of reality. Complex issues can be made accessible to a large number of people; both experts and non-experts. 
Our Games accelerate consensus amongst multiple stakeholders, support informed decision making and resolve conflicts. Stakeholders have fun and engage in the process genuinely.

We tailor our Games according to each specific case. With over five years experience worldwide, we have worked on urban projects of all scales as well as on refugee camps, violence prevention and other multi-stakeholder challenges. 

By interning with us you will become an active member of our team, with responsibility over current projects and the opportunity to directly contribute with your work. You can expect personal guidance as well as open ears to your thoughts and ideas.</description>

¿	Load distribution

Current used loads do not take into account fatigue calculations. They can be too severe and generate over design. The final goal of an FEA is to predict the life of a design for a given load. So it really important to know what are the loads on the parts during all the vehicle life. The goal of the training is to define a methodology to achieve this objective.</description>

        <description>The Institute for Energy Transition (ITE) Supergrid is a collaborative research platform in the
field of low-carbon energy, bringing together the expertise of industry and public research in
the logic of public-private co-investment and close cooperation between all stakeholders of
the sector.
The institute aims to develop technologies for the Supergrid that enable the future electricity transmission networks, using direct current and alternating current at very high voltages (in the order of one million volts), designed to transport energy production centres, including offshore renewable sources, to large cities.

General context
Program 3 of SuperGrid Institute addresses power electronic converters for MVDC &amp; HVDC. In particular, we develop DC-DC converters, medium frequency transformers and high voltage power semiconductor devices. SuperGrid Institute develops the new generation of power semiconductors targeting the
breakdown voltage of 10kV and more. This requires the design and test of converter elements (busbars, PCBs, semiconductor packaging) which can sustain this voltage. A new set of equipment will be used for the high voltage test. The purpose of this internship is to design a functional test system based on this equipment.

Objectives / Missions
1. Implement methods for the measurement of various parameters (breakdown voltage, leakage current, conductivity), with the following schedule
   a. literature survey, to list the conditions required to perform the measurements, and to identify possible limitations;
   b. design of the test system, particularly taking into account the safety regulations (remote control of the test system);
   c. implementation of the software (Matlab) and hardware (based on the source and meter purchased for this internship) parts of the test system.
2. Demonstrate the results on various parts of converters.
   a. Characterization of known elements (which have already been characterized on external test systems);
   b. test of new parts.
As high voltages (10-20 kV) are involved, safety is a major concern of this topic. A specific training (?habilitation?) will be provided, and all tests will be performed in an enclosed facility, with only remote access allowed. This means that the software part of the test system must
control all the test equipment (no direct user interaction is allowed on the test equipment).
Such remote-control technique is commonly used at Supergrid, so some code base and support are already available.
With the idea of anticipating a further PhD thesis on dielectric design, we also plan to characterize various converter parts (for example ceramic substrates, which have already been characterized by other labs). This will help us improve our knowledge of the dielectric behaviour of materials, and calibrate the test system.

The internship will be realised in collaboration with the Ampere laboratory. The internship student will work in a research group of around 20 people and will collaborate closely with a group of PhD students, engineers and scientific researchers. A PhD thesis on the dielectric
design and the failure mechanisms of insulating materials is scheduled to start in 2018 giving an opportunity to continue the experience at SuperGrid Institute.</description>

        <description>Understanding how cells interact with their environment is of great importance for the developmentof tissue-engineering therapies in which cells are combined with various biomaterials to encouragethe formation of new body tissues. When cells attach to a biomaterial substrate, they generatetraction forces by anchoring to the solid material and contracting (Fig. 1) [1]. These forces play akey role for cellular decision-making, driving processes including cell adhesion, proliferation anddifferentiation. However, the fundamental mechanisms of mechano-sensing (how cells translatemechanical cues into biochemical signals) remain poorly understood. 

The objective of this project is to develop a model for cell adhesion and response to material cues. In the proposed model, a cell will be represented by a soft elastic solid, interacting with thesubstrate through discrete adhesion points [2]. The adhesion forces will in turn generate biochemical signals, triggering cell remodelling [3]. The model will be implemented within a initeelement software in order to simulate cell-substrate interactions. The effects of substrate stiffness, cell shape and substrate patterning will be investigated. Numerical predictions will be compared toexperimental data generated in our group. 

This project is a first step in a new research program at Monash aiming at bringing togetherresearchers in mechanics and biology. It is suited for a candidate with a strong interest in modellingand simulations. If successful, the project will be pursued at larger scale in the context of a PhDthesis at Monash. Candidates interested in a PhD in modelling cell mechano-sensing are especiallyencouraged to apply.

        <description>In Switzerland, the retirement/pension scheme is based on the 3 pillars system [2]: the state pension (pillar1, AVS), the occupational pension (pillar 2, LPP), and the private pension (pillar 3 a+b). Because of a constant increase of life expectancy (the number of retired people is growing with respect to the active people), Swiss Federal authorities proposes and is studying a reform of this system (Prévoyance 2020 [3]).
Pension institutions are managing a huge mass of money aimed to cover the main part of Swiss Citizens future revenues during retirement. One of the major challenges in this boiling market is to empower Swiss citizens with the full transparency on the 3 Swiss pillars of pension, in order to choose their best personal strategies.
ELCA is the first Swiss company that provides a core system covering services in multiple areas of the Swiss pension pillars and hence is an excellent candidate to support Swiss citizens in reaching the optimal outcome of this challenge.
The goal of this project is to develop the first prototype of a Swiss pension robo-advisor for Swiss citizens using Big Data and ELCA technical best practices and business knowledge. More concretely, the incumbent will be responsible to propose, develop, and deploy mathematical models to address a previously defined Swiss pension fund use-case.

OBJECTIVES
The objective of this project is to generate a computational prototype that advise on optimal strategies to optimize pension funds, using simulated data (that may include Swiss pension 3 pillars data, Swiss taxes data, mortgage data, bank account data, social media data and other types of online data).
The goal of this project is to identify, apply and validate an analytical approach to prove the value of a big data use case within the Swiss pension fund system.

MISSIONS
Using millions of Emoji for supervised learning of Emotions, Sentiments and Sarcasm Since the rise of the social web and the explosion of social networks, billions of users express their thoughts, moods and opinions on a wide range of topics. Being able to detect, monitor, analyze and understand opinions expressed on those platforms has become a key component of Social Media Intelligence. This ?eld of research is known as Opinion Mining. Opinion mining aims to determine the attitude of a speaker, writer, or other subject with respect to some topic and to identify the overall contextual tonality, emotional reaction, affective state expressed by the subject. At Link?uence, we are applying natural language processing, machine learning and deep learning approaches to perform opinion mining in real-time and batch processing. Such applications are Sentiment Analysis or affect expressions extraction and classi?cation. We are looking for an intern to work on new algorithms for emotions and sarcasms detection using supervised learning. In many natural language processing tasks, supervised machine learning approaches have proved most effective, and substantial effort has been made into collecting and annotating corpora for building such models. Emotion detection from text is no exception; however, research in this area is in its relative infancy, and few emotion annotated corpora exist to date. One approach to address these problems is to use self-annotated data, using explicit indications of emotions included by the author of the data in question. In social media sentiment analysis and related tasks, researchers have therefore used binarized emoticons and speci?c hashtags as forms of distant supervision. Recent approaches (Wood and Ruder, 2016, Felbo and al, 2017) are extending this distant supervision by using more diverse set of noisy labels: Emoji. The model can then learn richer representations and yield signi?cant performance improvements over past techniques. During the internship, you will apply and benchmark the state-of-the-art approaches using Emoji for Emotion detection on our archive data composed of billions of social media posts. You will use a range of deep-learning, natural language processing and machine learning methods to implement, train and evaluate the models.

        <description>The interns' task will be to contribute to ongoing research projects in the HIT Lab NZ
related to multisensory user experience. In particular, towards the extension of our
sensory surround systems for immersive simulation (SSS).
Our SSS is used for several research projects in combination with various VR
development platforms (Unity3d &amp; C#, Prepar3D &amp; C++/C#, Unreal &amp;
C++/Blueprint). All interns will work on developing extensions/plugins/modules for
the SSS that can be used in one or more projects.

One of the projects that will require interns to work on is the air attack supervisor
virtual reality training system for fire fighters (Fig 1). It is an exciting and valuable
application of VR technology to aerial firefighting skill development. This system offers
the opportunity to train firefighters in this role anytime, anywhere, with greater task immersion than conventional training techniques in asafe and effectivemanor. 
Firefighters training for Air Attack Supervision (AAS) can now train collaboratively and more frequently in a virtual environment, the skills they need to be effective and give them more time on task to acquire skills and maintain their currency in AAS.

One of the requirements is to develop software systems (plugins) that interfaces with
the platform software (Prepare3D) used in our AAS SSS for the training of firefighters
that supervise the air attack of wildfires. The end-users will have the option to use
Air Attack Firefighter Training Simulator in 270° projection system either, a 270-degree projection system (SimPit), an Oculus Rift or a regular desktop and screen interface. C++ and/or C# will be the primary programming language(s).

Another requirement is to create a software interface that allows to dynamically adjusting the
vibration/wind/smell feedback within for our TactaCage platforms depending on the user's parameters and the displayed virtual scenario.
Programming language will be C# for the UI to control of the vibration floor.
A key element to enhance the training effect is to provide a feedback mechanism,
which allows showing the users' task specific feedback as well as feedback on their
physiology (e.g. the level of stress). The plugin will read the following from a wireless
sensor (Zephyr, BioHarenss 3, Bluetooth) heart rate variability, rate of breath and
other physiological responses and either display this to the user or change some aspect
about the scenario based on the wearer's stress level or both. When using the system
in a multi-person collaborative environment, the system will show the stress state of
other players in the simulation, so they can get a feeling for each others level of stress
and be able to communicate with the other person based on their emotion or stress
level.


A high level of professionalism in software engineering is expected. This includes
appropriate time and resource management and the development of correct, well-
designed, readable, revision-controlled and efficient code that is well documented.</description>

Team Description:
The Search, Shopping &amp; Pricing (SSP) product engineering group serves the core Distribution business of Amadeus as well as Airline IT e-commerce business and the Rail IT and Travel Intelligence new businesses. It is responsible in particular for the travel Search and Shopping products, which power today a vast number of airline and travel agent websites. 
In the Analytics and Data Mining department (ADM) we leverage the data produced by SSP core products to build analytics for the travel industry. A typical data set consists of hundreds of million travel searches that turn into billions of travel recommendations (I.e. Terabytes) every day.

Main Responsibilities:
Our Analytics tool provides analytics based on hundreds of billions of travel recommendations. To deal with these volumes we rely on sampling. However sampling removes information, especially rare events. We need to increase the quality of our data set thanks to stratified sampling on several dimensions: we want to apply different sampling ratios depending on criteria in data to ensure higher diversity. 

The goal of the internship is to analyse our initial data set to:
-	Identify the main diversity losses and define KPIs to measure them
-	Propose and test strategies to improve diversity while keeping accuracy
-	Validate solution on significant volumes with Spark

Requirements:
-	Communication skills (English)
-	Analytical mind
-	Technical: Statistics, Hadoop/Spark is a plus.</description>

        <description>Title: Design and development of a new high power density reducer for electromechanical automotive brake.

A Brake-by-Wire system implemented with one micro-controller and one actuator per wheel can significantly increase the quality of the braking, in particular, by reducing the stopping distance.
Moreover, this technology provides more precise braking by adapting to the pressure the driver puts on the pedal. Like Steer-by-Wire, there is a significant decrease in the weight of the vehicle in removing the hydraulic braking system and, therefore, significantly lowering costs. Finally, Brake-by-Wire will help to protect the environment because no braking fluid is necessary.

In that context, Chassis Brakes International is looking for a 6 month internship focused on the development of an innovative and compact reducer technology for automotive electromechanical brake application.

A previous version based on hypocycloïdal technology has already been designed and need to be improved in terms of compacity/calculus and potential cost. The student will have to calculate and design a new version of the actuator fitting an electrical brake mechanism.

The student will work with the mechatronic R&amp;D team under responsibility of a senior engineer in mechatronic systems development and a mechanical engineer with experience in reducers design.

Missions: 		-State of the art/ Benchmarking of existing hypocycloïdal reducer solutions
			- Calculus sheet creation/improvement
			-Technological solution iterations
			-3D CAO, Physical modelling, drawings 
			-Prototyping ( 3D printing and conventional)
			-Testing &amp; Validation

        <description>CONTEXT:

In the next few years, more electric hybrids, range-extended hybrids and full electric vehicles will be coming to the consumer market. With the introduction of various types of hybrid electric and pure electric vehicles (PEV), several new challenges have arisen for noise and vibration engineers. 

This internship will focus on the ancillary system noise like the Air Conditioning System managing the cooling/heating in the interior of the vehicle or the engine/battery cooling systems. In those systems, one specific component, the low-speed fans (axial and/or centrifugal) are well-known to produce sound source level which can strongly disturb the vehicle passengers.

Consequently, some fast and robust numerical tools to predict the aero-acoustic performances of those FAN are very important. For industrial application, those tools should rely on hybrid methods combining a first CFD computation with an acoustic analogy.

OBJECTIVES:

Historically, two research projects were undertaken from 2008 to 2016 with VALEO on air conditioning systems (HVAC) for the automotive industry. During those projects (2008:2011 CESAM and 2013:2016 CEVAS), the noise generated by the turbulent flow through different passive ducted components (simple and double diaphragm, flap, heat exchanger, bends) has been investigated experimentally and numerically by the Roberval Laboratory of UTC and ESI Group. More recently, an extension of the Lighthill and Curle formulations have been developed for exterior aero-acoustic problems for fixed obstacles coupling Boundary Element (BEM) and Finite Element Methods (FEM) using an adaptive boundary condition and a Domain Decomposition Method (DDM). The objectives of this work would be to adapt that formulation to consider axial fan (ducted or in free-space) through a porous surface approach. Firstly, the transient simulation will be carried out by using a Detached Eddy Simulation (DES) based on the Spallard-Allmaras turbulence model to accurately resolve the complex flow field using the open source OpenFOAM software. Since version 2.1.0, the arbitrary mesh interface (AMI) was implemented. The AMI allows simulation across disconnected and adjacent mesh domains, which are especially required for rotating geometries.

Similarly, to the Kirchhoff method, the acoustic step consists in introducing a fictitious surface separating both moving and the fixed domains. Then, the Lighthill's analogy is employed to compute the acoustic field from the aero-acoustic sources defined in the volume of the fixed domain but also from the sources located on the fictitious boundary. The moving part of the domain is not more considered in the acoustic step. 

Tasks Planned:
1-	CFD (OpenFOAM) and Acoustics (VAOne + Rayon solver) software handling
2-	Full chaining applications (CFD+Acoustics) for fixed obstacles
3-	Validations/comparisons of two aero-acoustics formulations for volume sources (Hydrodynamic Pressure (Ph) vs Lighthill's Tensor)
4-	Parametric studies (mapping, modal approach, source domain dimension)
5-	Investigation of moving meshes for Fan Noise (AMI in OpenFOAM) and Lighthill-Curle porous formulation for acoustics.

Skills Needed:
- Engineering Study in Acoustics with some basis in Aero-Acoustics
- Good knowledge in Computational Fluid Dynamics, Acoustics, Numerical Methods and Software Development (Matlab, Fortran)
- Team Work

From September 3rd 2018 to February 28th 2019

        <description>One of the most promising approaches to repair the injured tissues is to use a tissue engineering method that combines implantable materials and cells. For instance, recent new bone substitutes combine stiff scaffolds and bone cells. Unfortunately, their scaffold lack of toughness and fail for mimicking bone mechanical competence. Regarding bone mechanical competence, bone presents a specific combination of high stiffness, high toughness and high strength that we currently fail to reproduce in vitro. This astonishing combination is the result of a self-assembly process involving proteins and minerals. However, mechanics of this self-assembly process are not fully understood and there is a pivotal lack of knowledge about how bone cells' protein control bone mineralization. This lack of knowledge is one of the major obstacles to synthesizing bone-like material in tissue engineering.
This project's overarching research objective is to build a bone-like material. The central hypothesis is that one key is to control cells' production of specific bone proteins (inhibitors and nucleators of mineralization) by using mechanical stimuli. To test this hypothesis, this project will first determine the patterns of proteins production - inhibitors and nucleators of mineralization - by bone cells through mechanical stimuli. Thus, we will control the mineralization process of our new scaffold to reach a combination of high stiffness, high toughness and high strength.
?
This project will combine experimental tools available at Dr. Berteau lab at City University of New-York, CSI), at the Advances Sciences Research Center Pr Ulijn La.
Internship objective: The goal of this project is to investigate the role of the collageneous and non collageneous protein on the mechanical response of bone tissue in new soft gel and to build a first bone-like material.  
Requested competences: Bachelor's degree (preferably in Chemical or Biomedical Engineering) Strong interpersonal and organizational skills are mandatory. Starting date: To be determined with candidate Contact: jean.berteau@csi.cuny.edu. VISA fees and flight between NYC and Europe sponsored. Students housing options available.

        <description>Context: During the course of a severe accident in a Pressurized Water Reactor, large amounts of hydrogen could be generated and released into the containment. The integrity of the containment could be hazarded by certain hydrogen combustion modes. As boundaries between the different combustion modes are characterized by narrow gas concentration bandwidths, gas distribution calculations are needed to generate the initial conditions of a subsequent combustion process.

Objective:  The objectives of the proposed internship is to evaluate and improve the capacity of the CEA in-house CFD code TrioCFD to make predictions of pressure-, temperature- and gas concentration distribution inside containments under severe accident conditions. Such predictions are relevant for the assessment of the conception of existing and future containments. TrioCFD has already shown its capacity to correctly predict the formation and erosion of helium stratification layers. Simple models to treat steam condensation in the volume (fog formation) and on cooled walls will be added as source terms to TrioCFD. This simplified modelling will be tested on the separate effect CONAN experiment of the University of Pisa and on the integral MISTRA experiment used in the international standard problem ISP47. 

TrioCFD: TrioCFD http://www-trio-u.cea.fr/  is the CFD reference code of the Nuclear Energy Division of CEA for unsteady, low Mach number, turbulent flows. The code, developed at CEA-Saclay, is especially designed for industrial CFD calculations on structured (parallelepipeds) and non-structured (tetrahedrons) grids of several hundreds of millions of elements. The object oriented, intrinsically parallel code structure is realized in C++. The user has the choice between various discretization methods and can combine several appropriate physical models including different methods to treat turbulence. The code is used on a daily basis for safety studies on massively parallel computers by using up to 10000 processor cores. 

Location, Duration and Skills: The internship position is located in the south of Paris at CEA-Saclay. The position is proposed for 6 month. The applicant should have some knowledge in CFD. Mastering the complete simulation chain (CAD-modelling, meshing, CFD-calculation and post-processing) will be appreciated. Coding experiences is a plus but not mandatory.</description>

        <description>Air Liquide is the worldwide leader for gases for industry, health, and associated technologies and services. It is present in 80 countries with 65,000 employees worldwide. Its revenue is more than 20 billion euro in 2017.

Context
Based in Kuala Lumpur, the Smart Innovative Operations Center is gradually being connected to 18 units producing gases for industry and health in South East Asia and the Pacific.

In the production units, the teams are able to focus on equipment safety and performance:
? control and drive production 24/7
? in parallel, adjust energy consumption in real time
? conduct predictive maintenance actions

Like a control tower, the center's teams monitor on-screen all the oxygen, nitrogen, argon and hydrogen needs of customers in South East Asia (SEA). They adjust the production of all units in real time to meet customer demand, whether they are continuously supplied by pipeline or delivered by a fleet of more than 150 trucks. Production instructions are transmitted remotely via secure networks, enabling teams to start up a unit, set production levels, or stop production.

Thanks to this technology, Air Liquide is improving the energy efficiency of its own installations by reducing CO2 emissions as much as possible. Using big data analytics, the operating center teams identify the most efficient settings for each production unit in a bid to save energy. When electricity consumption peaks in the SEA cluster, the operation center adjusts the various production volumes of each unit to meet the demand of industrial customers, achieving the best energy efficiency depending on the geographic area concerned.

Missions
The intern will be working in the Digital Performance Centre team, together with a team of Performance Analytics Engineers and with the support of Industrial IT experts. He/she will develop tools and methods to:
- optimization of networks and production plants (Air Separation Units and HyCOs) 
- try new optimization algorithms 
- implement innovative solutions for energy efficiency
- develop training material for these new tools for Real Time Engineers

Competencies
? Chemical engineering
? AIMMS software
? Excel, SCADA systems
? PowerBI is a plus

        <description>This six month internship project deals with development of efficient image segmentation procedures for shoulder implants. As part of post-operative surgical assessments, patients receiving shoulder implants routinely undergo computed tomography (CT) imaging. This provides insights on fit of the implant with surrounding bone. However, due to imaging artefacts caused by scattering of X-rays around metal implants it is often difficult to evaluate the fit of the implant. Latest state-of-the-art imaging software such as Mimics provide options to reduce and in some cases to fully remove imaging artefacts. This project will explore the imaging capabilities of Mimics with respect to removal of imaging artefacts around implants. Furthermore, the generated images of the shoulder will be converted into finite element models of the shoulder to investigate stress / strain distribution around the implant and it is effect on stress shielding of the surrounding bone.

The internship candidate will work with the Queensland Unit of Advanced Shoulder Research (QUASR) on the following tasks

- 	Computed tomography Imaging of patients before and after shoulder implant surgery 
- 	Image segmentation around shoulder implants to correct for scattering effects at the implant-bone interface
- 	Use of the mimic image segmentation software
- 	Develop finite element models of the shoulder

        <description>Motivations and general objectives:
The recent accepted ANR CLARA(Coupled Learning &amp; Vision for Aerial robot Control) project (2019 to 2023) aims to extend the autonomous navigation of Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in complex environment such as in a forest. In such environment, the autonomous navigation is a challenging problem due to many constraints:
- The loss of GPS signals makes methods based making way-point unusable.
- Dense and unstructured environments (branches, foliage, ...) reduce visibility.
Nevertheless, the use of aerial drones in this type of environment is of great interest and can be broken down into multiple prevention and / or surveillance applications such as fire detection, search for missing people, mapping for forest maintenance, etc. Without GPS signals, a vision system seems essential to navigate in this environment. In order to generate a 3D map for autonomous navigation, the vision sensor has to recover the 3D in all direction. Thus, we choose in this project to embedded a 360 stereoscopic vision system on the UAV to navigate safely in its environment. Nowadays, Deep learning (DL) techniques have dramatically improved the state of the art in many fields: object detection, speech recognition, voice generation, music generation, etc. They produced results comparable to human experts even sometimes superior [1]. These methods are also used for navigation tasks and shown really interested results for navigation in wild environment [2] These methods are now usable because we have a large amount of data sets from learning the model. Nevertheless, if many databases have been produced for perspective cameras [3], only few exist for spherical camera. Thus, the architecture proposed for perspective camera cannot be easily used for spherical camera as we do not have enough data to train the model.
To solve this problem, two solutions can be considered:
a) create our own database based on our own sensor. If this solution can be feasible, it necessitates a huge set of data and have to be done for each specific sensor, which is time consuming and not powerful.
b) use existing database from perspective sensors and adapt it for our own sensor. This solution would be efficient since it does not require any modifications or additions of existing database.
Thus, in this master thesis, we propose to develop a way to use available database acquired with classical perspective cameras for spherical sensors in order to avoid to generate new data for this specific sensor. Two solutions will be studied. Once will consist in modifying the data into a spherical space to be coherent with the spherical image. The second way, as the DL methods are strongly related to convolution computation which is not directly equivalent into a spherical image, we will propose to develop a new convolution adapted for spherical imaging and equivalent to perspective images [4][5].
This work will be done in collaboration with Pr. Cédric Demonceaux (LE2I-ERL VIBOT) and Guillaume Allibert (I3S/INRIA Chorale Team) and will take place in INRIA Sophia Antipolis.
This Master thesis will be extended to a PhD position if the candidate obtains satisfactory results. 

Desired experiences or qualification of the student:
The candidate will have to have solid skills in development (MATLAB, C / C ++, Python, LINUX, ROS, Git, OpenCV, TensorFlow). He will also have a taste for research, for fundamental work and multidisciplinary opening.</description>

        <description>Team Description:
Ever wonder why the price of a flight seems to change every time you look? The answer lies in field of airline revenue management. The Amadeus revenue management research and development team designs and implements the systems airlines use to make decisions about the prices of their flights. Our airline customers use our solutions to manage hundreds of millions of euros in revenue across thousands of flight departures per day.
 
Project Description:
A typical traveler will visit nearly 40 websites before making a purchase decision, and will be exposed to hundreds of combinations of itineraries and prices. Some travelers will care most about getting the lowest price, while others are more interested in schedules or other itinerary attributes. Understanding how passengers make these decisions is crucial to successful revenue management.
The goal of the internship is to build subject matter expertise in traditional and newly-emergent approaches to customer choice modeling (CCM), and to use big data and machine-learning to analyze which CCMs best represent real-life decision passenger making. The results of the internship will have high visibility within the group and will help inform the design and methodology used in our revenue management systems.
This internship will be cross-site between Amadeus's Revenue Management Competency Center in Copenhagen, Denmark (3 months), and the Amadeus main R&amp;D site in the Nice area (3 months).
 
The internship will involve:
Familiarization with the basic concepts of airline revenue management.
Reviewing the academic choice modeling literature, including machine-learning approaches.
Designing experiments to test the performance of various customer choice model's using airline data.
Accessing and processing airline passenger shopping session data from big data warehouses.
Implementing and interpreting statistical tests.
Presenting a recommendation for which choice model(s) are best suited for airline revenue management applications.</description>

        <description>Understanding cognitive overload of humans in critical drone piloting conditions is complex. One must be able to perform piloting with a perfect control of their parameters and conditions. To address this issue, the SYRI team proposes to design a virtual reality (VR) system which is able to simulate the real system targeted by the study. In this simulation, the real drone will be represented through a VR setup involving stereoscopic visual immersion, 3D sound perception, motion tracking of the user, and possibly some tangible devices using the new immersive room (CAVE) TRANSLIFE.
Objective
The dynamic metaphor will be a 3D interaction metaphor (EBBAG type) to predict the trajectory of the real drone, compared to the virtual drone: the internship will develop a first prototype of simple piloting with gesture guidance. The work will be based on the theses of Belem Rojas and Florian Jeanne. The metaphor will be a resumption of the existing metaphor, with adaptation and algorithm for calculating the error corresponding to teleoperation.
 
Methodology
 
- modeling and development / virtual drone handled by the user in the CAVE, indicating a trajectory with interfaces of the CAVE, tracking the gesture of the user
- sending the 3D CAVE position to the real drone (command) then real drone tracking, measurement of real drone position transmitted in the CAVE (in collaboration with the platforms engineers)
- modeling of the difference between real drone position, and position indicated by the user in the CAVE, then visualization of the position error by the dynamic metaphor
- validation by experimental tests
- final internship report

        <description>La résolution de coréférence cherche à détecter des mentions de chaines de coréférence dans un texte, c'est-à-dire des mentions qui font référence à la même entité dans un texte.
La résolution de coréférence était divisée en deux sous-problèmes séparés : la détection de mentions et la résolution de mentions coréférentes. Grâce au développement de modèles neuronaux sophistiqués, des systèmes de résolution de coréférence permettent aujourd'hui de faire d'une pierre deux coups.
L'objectif de ce stage est d'étudier les modèles neuronaux Sequence-to-Sequence et Transformer pour la résolution de coréférence, en intégrant différents types de mécanismes d'attention et une possibilité de contexte arbitrairement long, en vue d'en comprendre l'impact dans la résolution de ce problème complexe du Traitement Automatique du Langage.

Lors de ce stage, l'étudiant implémentera des parties de systèmes de résolution de coréférence avec des modèles neuronaux Sequence-to-Sequence et Transformer. L'étudiant réalisera des expériences en GPU, et les systèmes seront testés sur le benchmark CoNLL Semeval 2012.

***************************

Coreference resolution aims at detecting chains of coreference mentions in a text, that is mentions in the text that refer to the same entity.
While at first coreference resolution was split into two separated sub-problems, i.e. mention detections and resolution of coreferent mentions, thanks to the development of sophisticated neural models, end-to-end coreference resolution system can be based on a whole single model.
The aim of this internship is to study Sequence-to-Sequence and Transformer neural models for coreference resolution, integrating different types of attention mechanisms and possibly arbitrarily-long context, with the goal of understanding their impact in dealing with this complex NLP problem.

In this internship the student will implement parts of the systems for coreference resolution with Sequence-to-Sequence and Transformer neural models.
The student will run experiments on its own using GPUs, and the systems will be tested on the CoNLL Semeval 2012 benchmark.

Profile:
- Student for internship level stage (Master 2) in computer science, or from engineering school
- Computer science skills:
    Python programming with good knowledge of deep learning libraries (TensorFlow or PyTorch)
    Textual data manipulation (xml format, tabular format, CoNLL format)
- Interested in Natural Language Processing
- Skills in machine learning for probabilistic models

The internship may last from 4 up to 6 months, it will take place at LIG laboratory, GETALP team, starting from January/February 2019.
The student will be tutored by Marco Dinarelli and Laurent Besacier.</description>

        <description>This proposal is in 
the scope of ?Interaction and cooperation between systems?

The  algorithms  based  on  the  consensus  remain  today  very  interesting  within  the framework  of  the  implementation  of  robot  fleets.
Autonomous  formation  control, flocking and mobile sensor networks are examples of areas where these algorithms can be  applied.Works in  [1],  [2]  and  [3]  propose  consensus - based  control  algorithms  for several agents. In addition, the work of [4] and [5] deals with the problem of consensus-based  estimation  algorithms,  particularly  with  Kalman  consensus  filters.However, existing algorithms are mainly used on linear models and do not study robustness against disturbances.In  a  previous  Master thesis,  we  proposed  a  distributed  algorithm  for  estimating  the centroid  of  a  fleet  knowing  only  the  neighbour  estimates  of  each  agent. This  study showed  that  the  approach  could  work  with  a  mobile  fleet,  presenting  a  varied  and variable connectivity graph with good robustness to disturbance of measurements.The objective of this thesis is to extend the previous study by starting from the proposed perspectives (mainly the extension of the size of the state for each agent). We will then study  the  robustness  of  the  algorithm  compared  to  the  constraints  imposed  by a  real communication network (delay, flow).Finally, we will study a control algorithm using the  calculated  centroid  to  guide  the fleet.  The  conservation  of  the  connectivity  of  the graph may be a criterion to take into account in guiding each agent.


The candidate  will begin with a  review of the  literature  on existing robust consensus-based  estimation  and  control  algorithms. He-she can  then  propose  the  expected extensions of the previous results and validate them in simulation. As such, Airplug tools can be advantageously used to consider the constraints of the communication network in different  scenarios  of connectivity  and  mobility. Finally,  the  candidate  will  be  able  to 
validate the algorithms on a flotilla of mobile robots equipped with Airplug</description>

        <description>Accurately learning the preferences of agents or users is of paramount importance in many applications and situations, including the choice of public policies, products, etc. If we wish to make personalized recommendation, it is desirable to acquire information directly from the agent/user. However, such information is costly to acquire (the user does not want to answers too many questions), and may suffer from severe uncertainties (the user may not be sure about some preferences). This internship aims at developing preference learning strategies that:
* Are optimal, in the sense that the strategy should minimize the number of asked questions;
* Account for uncertainties and identify possible inconsistencies, using those to identify errors in the modelling assumptions or in the user information.
We expect the candidate to develop and validate such methods on first simple preference models (weighted averages, dominance models), before proceeding to more complex models (non-additive functions, lexicographic orderings) if progress are sufficient.

PROPOSED THEME: ¿Paperless Trucks¿ Project. Veolia is rolling out a new information technology system for our
vehicle fleet. The system features include ¿real-time¿  job  dispatch  to  vehicles,  ¿real  time¿  job  confirmation, GPS 
tracking of vehicles on the street maps, fleet data management, route optimisation, customer signature capture and
load cell integration (weighing of each bin on pickup). The technology is expected to be ready for implementation
into the trucks in April 07 and will take approximately six months. There is an excellent opportunity for Alexandre to
be involved in this project. Alexandre would work with the Paperless trucks team in NSW, and assist in the roll-out of
the system into the NSW fleet by providing systems support to the drivers/operators during the 6 month rollout
period. As a result, Alexandre would obtain substantial experience in the roll-out of a highly complex and innovative
logistics technology and the get a real understanding of the challenges faced with in regards to change management.

        <description>The goal of the project is to ensure good representativeness of a datasets prior to learning. Often data are unbalanced, either by lack of measures, or because of an incorrect sampling strategy with respect to the goals of the problem to solve. Measures and scores exist for revealing unbalanced datasets (F1-score, precision/recall, etc.) however it is not clear how to efficiently use them with respect to the key challenges one try to solve. Our objective is to define and test several metrics with respect to a reference dataset in order to identify the most valuables ones.</description>

        <description>The Media Analysis team helps users turn raw content into sharable edits. Feature-specific algorithms provide an understanding of video content; for example, through our accelerometer, we know when the user went off a jump, and through our audio, we know if the user cheered during capture. This intern will use these data streams, coupled with decisions our users make, to improve the content our users receive. Do our users want speed or smooth shots? Do they want faces or voices? Jumps or cheers?
This task will require the ability to extract, transform, and load data from audio, video, and other sensors' signals. You will need to write readable code, communicate effectively on an international team, and work (at various times) independently and collaboratively towards defined goals. The intern will have working knowledge of deep reinforcement learning, signal detection, experimental design, and video editing. They will need to use and evaluate the algorithms they develop. Above all, they will need to be passionate about providing useful results to our users.</description>

        <description>The internship will focus on different aspects of 3D mesh optimisation for augmented reality:

-Mesh simplification: The restricted view point in specific 3D scenes means aggressive optimisations to decimate and combine meshes would be beneficial for real time performance. 
-Object scanning and room mesh construction: We have the ability to scan real world objects and generate a mesh for them, and then project captured images on to them to make a virtual version of a real object.  We often have trouble with holes in the mesh, complexity where it is not needed or approximated unseen surfaces. 
-Generating simple physics colliders based on scanned mesh: Colliding meshes or even convex hulls is pretty expensive. The geometry could be approximated with simple shapes like boxes and sphere for simple collisions. 

During the internship, the student will evaluate these issues reguarding mesh optimisation and test new meshing technics and algorithms to improve the real time performance of augmented reality software.</description>

        <description>Context: In the optimization of all kind of heat exchangers, a precise knowledge of the flow field in the heat exchanger is essential for the optimization of the heat transfer. This is also true for the heat transfer in nuclear reactors, where the temperature of the coolant is close to the temperature of onset of nucleate boiling. Especial in Sodium cooled reactors, the local formation of gas bubbles can lead to sever accidents. It is thus essential to understand in detail the flow field in the fuel assemblies in order to avoid hot spots on the fuel rods. 

Objective: CEA-Saclay develops the Open Source Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code TrioCFD. This code is used for safety studies in nuclear installations and for the improved understanding of the interaction between chemical processes and turbulence. In the proposed internship, the code will be validated for the prediction of the complex flow in fuel assemblies of sodium cooled reactors. Therefore, detailed experimental data are available for comparison from Texas A&amp;M University.

Tasks: In a first step, the student will create the CAD model of the 61-pin fuel rod assembly. Drawings are available. The CAD model might be provided by Texas A&amp;M. Nevertheless, adaptations of the model to the needs of fluid dynamics are necessary. Starting from the CAD model, a correct meshing will be created in the second step. We expect mesh sizes of up to 100 million tetrahedral cells. Then, in the third step, the flow will be simulated with TrioCFD by running calculations on the most powerful French computers. Finally, experiment and calculation will be compared. Commercial and Open Source tools will be used for CAD modelling and meshing.

        <description>First project:

One of the great challenges in representing the dynamic environment from uncertain measurements is to associate these measurements to established object hypotheses or derive new ones from them. This challenge get even more challenging when the environmental measurements are conflicted by noise or the area itself produces a lot of clutter.

Standard heuristic approaches are well known and studied. Probabilistic approaches promise more reliable hypotheses but have a tendency to become computationally intractable in dense situations due to their higher complexity. 
?Parallel tree boosting is a technique from the field of machine learning that was designed to work on big data sets. Therefore they seem to promise fast execution times for large combinations. At Ibeo, we apply this technique to other fields.
?The prototype that shall be developed, implemented and evaluated during this internship aims at deepening our understanding about possible applications for parallel tree boosting and determine if and to what degree we can benefit from using this technique within the field of dynamic object tracking. The prototype shall be integrated in the standard test car environment at Ibeo.


Second Project:

Another great challenge in representing the dynamic environment by usage of Bayesian modelling is solving the maneuvering problem of track hypotheses. The problem consists of predicting a system process, i.e. the dynamic objects motion, by means of a model.

The motion of real world dynamic objects often cannot be described by one simple motion model but changes often multiple times during short intervals. Techniques like the integrated multi model filter (IMM) are well known and studied, but due to their computational complexity are often not or only to some extend applied in productive systems. 
?The Task is manifold. First a general IMM shall be implemented and evaluated in terms of performance, complexity and time consumption.?Following a prototype shall be developed, implemented and evaluated that applies an IMM only on tracks that seem to be lost due to dynamic changes in their motion model. The scenario in question for this prototype is vehicles leaving or entering the motorway. Therefore a track loss recognition shall be developed and implemented, as well as the reprocessing of lost tracks with said. 
?An evaluation of performance, complexity and time consumption for this prototype shall be derived and compared to the standard approach and the pure IMM evaluation.
The prototype shall finally be integrated in the standard test car environment at Ibeo.</description>

        <description>Doxcelerate is a small company working for different U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) agencies. We host our software solutions on our own servers. We are looking at moving to a cloud platform provider such as Amazon Web Services (AWS).

The intern will participate in the daily life of our software development company. The intern will learn different technologies by assisting and working in close collaboration with the company's staff.
The intern will acquire knowledge about real product development life cycle, from conception to deployment to customers.

Previous interns helped us studying the feasibility of deploying some of our components to the cloud. But we still have most of the work to be done.  Our next intern would work at the infrastructure level, exploring and deploying different network configurations such as the ones listed below:
- Cross Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networking and internal shared Services access (probably with Transit Gateways Services and internal DNS setup),
- High Availability setup to replace our current use of BGP, VRRP and CAP (with AWS Elastic Load Balancers across AWS regions),
- Network security (with subnet configuration automated auditing and using systems such as CloudWatch and GuardDuty from AWS while understanding the place of network monitoring tools such as pfsense and HA Proxy in the context of AWS),
- Overall network configuration (for example we are now required by DOE to support ipv6),
- Possible Cross Cloud VPN configuration for additional backup layers.
The above work will also require the intern to become familiar with DevOps tools such as Ansible and AWS CloudFormation to automate the deployment of networking configurations as well as deploying Doxcelerate's applications.</description>

        <description>The process and experimentation division at IFP Energies Nouvelles aims at conducting experimental studies following the needs of IFPEN business units and of its industrial partners, particularly in the domain of testing the performances of new catalysts. The division develops efficient and performant chemical reactors of small sizes, using for example fixed beds of catalyst pellets, agitated vessels or micro-reactors. The comprehension and modelisation of physical and chemical phenomena appearing in these experimental tools is of primary importance. 

Computational Fluid Dynamics is more and more used to predict the performances of pilot units reactors. However, the complex physical phenomena involved requires coupling between several models, from hydrodynamics, turbulence, multiphase flows (Gas, Liquid and even Solids), thermal effects, chemical reactions with multiple species, etc ... 

In the case of Gas/Liquid flows, exchanges between the phases is a widely used phenomenon when a chemical reaction occurs in the liquid phase with a gas getting dissolved while it is consumed, or for stripping or saturation of gases in a liquid. A correct modelling of phase change between gas and liquids is thus of great importance in the CFD numerical methods. 

In the present project, we will use the opensource library and solvers OpenFOAM. OpenFOAM is a multi-purpose general library that can handle different physics and models. OpenFOAM is free of charge and provides a full access to all its sources, making it a valuable and flexible platform for the implementation, testing and integration of new models.

The objective of this training period will be to draw an inventory of OpenFOAM exisiting solvers and models accounting for phase change (both evaporation and condensation) in the framework of interface capturing methods. Interface capturing methods handle gas/liquid flows with high density ratio between the liquid and the gas. In OpenFOAM, the Volume of Fluid method is implemented. 

The trainee will work on well documented elementary test cases, like for example the Stefan problem, boiling of a liquid, etc... 
If phase change models of interest are found missing, the last part of the training could conduct to some development.

The workplan of the project would be :
- Bibliography study on phase change models for VoF methods
- Bibliography study of phase change models in OpenFOAM
- Exploratory task and inventory of existing solvers accounting for phase change in OpenFOAM
- Testing of phase change models on well known literature cases
        - 1D Stefan problem
        - Boiling case
        - Other test cases of interest (Taylor flow case, condensation case, etc...)
- Eventually, implementation of a phase change model not present in OpenFOAM

Student with the following background :
- Fluid Mechanics (multiphase, gas/liquid, incompressible flows, VoF, ...)
- Computational Fluid Dynamics, Numerical methods, Algorithm
- Ideally knowing OpenFOAM
- Knowledge of programmation in C++, Shell, Linux

        <description>About:
The project aims to reconfigure Distributed Energy Resource (DER) smart inverter settings and voltage regulation and protection devices to mitigate cyber attacks that cause voltage instabilities in electric power distribution systems.

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a technique that allows an automated autonomous agent to explore an interactive environment in order to learn how to solve a given problem without human intervention. RL leverages a simulation-based environment to train a better solution (also known as a &quot;policy&quot;) by allowing the solution to &quot;practice&quot; strategies in different episodes (i.e. simulation runs). For the project, RL will teach the control policy to be more robust to different kinds of attacks and network configurations. The structure of the policy itself can then be evaluated to automatically implement hardening strategies for particular elements of given distribution and automatically reconfigure the network, thereby stabilizing power flow on the grid.

Tasks:
&gt; Extend reinforcement learning reward function to take into account distribution system power quality, voltage regulation, and protection system constraints.  


&gt; Incorporate voltage regulation functionality into reinforcement learning reward mechanism.


&gt; Develop a scalable reinforcement learning training framework and algorithm to train an optimal policy for a single distribution system over 3 scenarios of different levels of PV penetration in 4 seasonal loading conditions.

        <description>Objective (s) of the project:

The project aims to translate a recently developed novel imaging method into the 3D domain, for 3D visualisation and mapping of the electrical currents in the heart.

State of the art &amp; rationale: 
It is crucial to be able to visualize and measure the electrical activation in the heart for the detection and diagnosis of a number of pathologies leading to potential cardiac arrest. However there is currently no technique that allows for direct imaging of the electrical activation non-invasively.
 Ultrafast acoustoelectric imaging (UAI) has recently been proposed as a novel method for providing 2D images of biological current densities [1]. The technique leverages the acoustoelectric effect, a modulation of a medium's electrical impedance when a pressure wave propagates through it. At the Institut Langevin, an integrated custom prototype was developed using existing programmable ultrasound systems, which allowed for the generation of 2D images of the electrical activation in the rat heart for the first time [2] [3]. 
However the technique is currently limited to the field of view of the ultrasound probe, which hampers its sensitivity. As a consequence, electrical current densities are only detected in some parts of the heart, while the electrical activation in the cardiac muscle is complex and anisotropic.

Methods and tools: 
The Institut Langevin has recently acquired several 3D ultrasound acquisition devices together with matrix transducer arrays which allow for ultrafast ultrasound emission and image formation in 3D. The programmable ultrasound devices are run using Matlab. The Institut Langevin is also equipped with fully certified facilities for small animal imaging and a range of phantom material which allows for experimental ultrasound imaging.

Main tasks: 	
Preliminary tests have already been conducted for 3D UAI, but the main task remaining is to optimize the acquisition and image formation process to allow precise visualisation of the biological currents in the whole organ.

Anticipated outcomes and potentials:
We believe that 3D ultrasound emissions mays highly increase the sensitivity of the technique and provide full temporal 3D views of the electrical activation in-vivo. This would pave the way for the development of a new 3D prototype, which in the future could be used in the clinic to diagnose cardiac activation dysfunctions such as arrhythmias.

        <description>Lalilo is a virtual assistant which helps educators teach primary school students how to read.

The startup was launched in 2016 by 3 engineers from École Polytechnique, with the goal of ending illiteracy with AI. In France 20% of the students who graduate from elementary school (collège) can't read proficiently enough to keep up with the academic demands of the classroom. In the U.S, that number goes up to 30%.

By providing individualised learning to students they want to drive that number down to 0.

To reach this goal, they have brought together experts in pedagogy, teachers, designers and technologists who work hand in hand to build the best classroom tools for students and educators.

        <description>The AS2M department of FEMTO-ST Institute, specialized in microrobotics and
micro-mechatronics investigate since more than 10 years on the design, modeling, fabrication, and control of microsystems and microrobots. Various systems have been achieved for micro-assembly and biomedical applications with smart actuators, sensors, and mechanisms at small scale. Creating structures with a suite of designed properties is one of key challenges in our society. Tackling this grand challenge will open pathways to create entirely new classes of materials, mechanisms, actuation modes, and control strategy. New material classes are combined with innovative mechanisms and efficient actuation modes in order to offer breakthrough advances in smart structures. Focusing at the nanoscale, one can observe that many new phenomena and application emerge [1][2]. Nanorobotics paradigm has two major research thrust areas [3]. The first area explores new methods for programmable manipulation and assembly of micro- and nanoscale entities as it is done to the manipulation area in macroscale robotics. The second research area focuses on overall miniaturization of mobile autonomous robots down to few ?m overall sizes with various locomotion capabilities such as flying, swimming, walking, hopping, rolling, and climbing. The needs for manipulating nanoscale objects are tremendous and deal with wide scope of applications (nanomaterials, nanophotonics, chemistry, biology) [4], [5].
In the framework of NanoFolding project, we envision the next generation of nanorobotics that combines the recent advances in material science, innovative mechanisms, and efficient actuation modes. To pave the way, we will investigate novel actuation modes based on folding at the matter level. Origami-based design of small-scale
robotics approach to achieve 3D motions and complex tasks will notably be investigated.
 The main idea of this internship is to develop actuation modes for NanoFolding
 project. The actuators can constitute an elementary bloc to design a nanogripper, discrete
 cannula nanorobot, a 3D digital nanorobot, and a nanoscale-soft-hand. The intern has to compare some promising advanced materials dedicated to nanoscale as thick films [10] and metamaterials [11]. He will design, simulate the behavior by using FEM, and fabricate some proof-of-concept by using the Nanoscribe machine and equipments available in MIMENTO cleanroom. The experimental setup will be fabricated to characterize
the fabricated structures.</description>

        <description>Details

The objective of the training is to design and implement the baseline of an electronic voucher server for the CAR products.

-Overall objective of the internship:

The goal of the internship is to design and implement the server application and the repository in charge of storing eVouchers, as well as the baseline protocol to support issuance, standard usage, reporting and purge of eVouchers. 



- Main Activities: 


The trainee shall first define macro specifications of the application as well as the data model of the database repository. The study will be followed by the development of a server prototype and its effective integration within the Amadeus reservation system as a proof of concept for demonstration and onward development of an industrial solution.


CAR providers are looking towards improvements of their IT solutions. Getting rid of paper vouchers and the legacy infrastructure required to operate them (specific printers and materials, stock and fraud control, accounting) is a mean for huge costs savings. 

The alternative is the issuance of electronic vouchers. No print of value coupons is needed anymore; the overall infrastructure costs are divided by a factor of 10. Electronic documents are stored into a repository and retrievable via different forms of identification. Controls and status query for usage can be applied on a real time basis; CAR providers can gather information for accounting purpose instantaneously, fastening their cash flow. 


Technically, the implementation of electronic vouchers (so called eVouchers) consists not only in the construction of an ad-hoc repository to store snapshots of car bookings at reservation or payment time. 


The core of the application must support various interactions with external systems, a.k.a. Distribution systems, Car counter desks applications, Car accounting applications. These interchanges are meant to control the status of these vouchers from their issuance up to their purge when used or outdated; status updates are triggered by travel agents and customer events (issuance, effective usage, exchange, refund).

        <description>Lipoxygenases are a class of widely distributed non-heme iron-containing enzymes, which catalyze the dioxygenation of polyenoic fatty acids containing at least one 1,4-cis,cis-pentadiene structural unit. From the different types of enzymes (5-, 8-, 12- and 15-lipoxygenases) the physiological role of human 15-lipoxygenase (15-LO) has been thoroughly investigated. It seems to be involved in various biological processes such as cell differentiation, inflammation, asthma, carcinogenesis and atherogenesis.
It is described to oxidatively modify LDL to an atherogenic form that is rapidly taken up by macrophages, which may develop into lipid loaden foam cells. These cells then induce the formation of atherosclerotic lesions in blood vessel walls. Inhibitors of 15-LO might reduce the risk for the development of atherosclerosis.
It has been demonstrate that LDL incubated with 15-LO cells is \&quot;minimally modified\&quot; and has bioactive properties. Characterization of LDL incubated with 15-LO cells reveals that lipid peroxidation is modest and, compared with LDL incubated on control cells, LDL incubated on 15-LO cells stimulated monocyte chemotaxis and when added to endothelial cells enhanced adhesion. This properties could be used to set up a secondary screening assay to evaluate the activity of 15-LO inhibitors on minimally modified LDL generation by cellular 15-LO.</description>

        <description>The public display system is potentially quite a large-scale development.  It would be best to be distributed in nature:

   1. A `server side¿ back-end (probably Java or C#) with database access (SQL) ¿ perhaps providing web-services for any clients, along with some HTML/CSS(/JavaScript) interfaces. 

   2. A choice between:
         1. A thin-client front-end (potentially allowing interfaces from anywhere) ¿ HTML/CSS/JavaScript is an obvious choice.  ¿AJAX¿ could be used to access the server¿s services.
         2. A medium-weight (but still web-delivered version) for example, Java Applet, Flash application, or even Microsoft¿s new `Silverlight¿ could be candidates.
         3. An full application (probably Java or C#) ¿ perhaps making SOAP calls to server-side web-services. 
 

   3. Local sensors and anything like web-cams, telephony devices (including microphone/speakers), interfaces to calendars and instant-messaging systems, etc. would need development in C++ (probably with the Win32 API and some COM work).  Native libraries could be created to provide access from higher-level Java or C#. </description>

        <description>Amadeus is responsible for part of British Airways Cargo System called BA80 hosted a TPF (Transaction Processing Facility) operating system. This is a real-time OS able to deliver fast, high-volume transaction processing across large and geographically dispersed networks.

BA80 supports the core operational movement of Cargo shipments worldwide. Its main operational activities include Air Waybill, freight and Unit Load Device (ULD) handling, flight preparation and customs interfaces within the operational flight window. It is also used to assist Yield Management, Pricing, Revenue Capture and other Ancillary Operations.
Parallel to that Amadeus has started to migrate its Passenger Reservation system from TPF to UNIX using modern design techniques and languages.

A previous internship has started to demonstrate that we can extend some aspect of the Passenger Reservation system to Cargo. This work needs to be continued.

Design and develop a prototype to show how the Cargo business flow can be implemented within existing frameworks. This prototype will include a GUI and a database to simulate the whole process.

Explore further what can be extended from Amadeus UNIX architecture, and software components for Cargo functionality. A lot of design analysis and C++ coding is still required to build a decent prototype.

Once a basic cargo database has been created via Teletype messages, other interfaces will have to be created to dialogue with other channels: GUIs, other structured messages interface.
Requirements:

Technologies
UML, C++, JDK 1.5, SQL, design patterns. Unix/Linux, Visual Studio .NET.

The right candidate will show his/her ability to become integrated within a team, autonomous, as well as his motivation to achieve a technical task within a limited timeframe. He must have strong analytical skills and good self-learner. </description>

        <description>The purpose of this project is to simulate the force distribution in the finger/hand during guitar playing and to optimise the motion of them. When we play the guitar, we feel the force from the string. This force must be distributed to the finger and hand'as equally as possible in every moment. The force distribution depends on the motion of the finger/hand. Therefore it is crucial to recognize every motion of finger/hand and force distribution during plucking. However the motion is so fast that it is difficult to follow both motion and force distribution. In a computer simulation, on the other hand, we are able to change the time scale and to visualize slowly the movement of every point of the finger/hand as well as the force distribution. Understanding of the optimum motion for the equal distribution of the force will help the guitarist to play better. In this project the applicant will in charge of the simulation and optimisation of the finger/hand motion using various CAD and FEM techniques.</description>

        <description>Rolling Contact Fatigue is a commonly observed failure mode in hardened  bearing steel components. In the SKF Engineering &amp; Research Centre, a research program to investigate the miscrostructure response during fatigue in bearings is carried out. A strong focus is put on the observation of fatigue processes in hardened bearing steels during bearing operation. Various tools are available for that, including Barkhausen Noise Analysis. This project is aiming at understanding the Barkhausen Noise Analysis signals that are obtenained during bearing operation. On basis of the experiments that are carried out, a relation between the Barklausen Noise Analysis and the bearing steel microstructure has to be established.</description>

For this purpose, two different models will be used : WPI gels mixed protein beads and WPI gels mixed with carragenan. Protein beads affect gel's microstructure whereas carrageenan does not. Textural properties of the gels will be characterized by rheological techniques. Their microstructure will be observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. And the interactions in the gels will be studied by z-potential measurements, technique which is available only at Wageningen University.

        <description>The RPPA or reverse phase protein array technology is a technology which allows the analysis of the activation status of key signaling proteins in cancer cell lines. The principle of this technology is based on the reversion of phases used for classical antibody arrays: i.e. for RPPA, tumor cell lysates are spotted on the array and the array is subsequently probed with the antibody of interest. In principle, all antibodies used for Western blotting can also be used on RPPA, provided the antibodies are specific.

- la validation des anticorps par Western blot 
(technologies: cultivation cellules, traitement cellules avec des inhibiteurs, préparation des lysats cellulaires et technologie Western blot).
- l'implementation du double marquage dans la technologie RPPA
(technologies: apprendre RPPA, tester plusieurs fluorophores pour la détection des anticorps pour le RPPA).</description>

        <description>This project has been designed, in a first step, to detail and list of actual processes used for the production of pellets and, in a second one, to analyze the possible alternatives for the future of pellet production. Information about pellets production costs and energy consumption for the production will be analyzed in this project.
The competition between different options (pellet production, pulp and paper industry, production of wood chips for energetic purposes) for the utilization of woody residues from the wood industry, especially saw mills, will be elaborated in detail. This comparison includes a detailed technical and economical analysis as well as estimations concerning the energy demand of the technical process needed to produce pellets, wood chips, and the input material for the pulp and paper industry or the chipboard industry. To be able to draw a picture of the future development of pellets a detailed analysis of the technical and economical aspects is needed.

        <description>Objective of the training 

The trainee will participate in the creation of a web application that allows the user to consult the Releasing offer on time effort, resources effort and cost of existing offers (deliveries requests, load activities, and project management) and estimation for a new offer based on current ones (by projection). The data (time effort, resources and cost for different tasks or activities) will be stored in a relational database and user-interfaces will allow the user to consult this information in a shopping center way (select an offer and put it in a shopping basket). 

Functionality 

The tool has to provide to the user a shopping center site of Releasing team offer. The tool will have the following functionalities: 

- Display the list of Releasing team tasks and activities with the cost for each one (time effort days, corresponding number of allocated resources by week / month or year). The user will have the possibility to convert figures in days / weeks / months / year (aka. men/days, men/weeks, men/months, men/years). 

- Reports can be exportable to TXT / XLS or XML file. 

- The user will have the possibility to make an estimation for a new package based on existing figures by selecting (drag and drop) current tasks and putting them in a shopping basket. For non-existing tasks or activities, the user can still create a new task and add it in the shopping basket; in this case the Releasing team will receive a notification by the tool to give an estimation for the new task and the user will be notified of the final cost estimation once all tasks costs are available.

        <description>In this project we test the hypothesis that an increase in tastant (salt and sugar) inhomogeneity in a food matrix enhances taste perception. Our previous study showed that an inhomogeneous distribution of sucrose in layered systems can enhance sweetness perception when the concentration gradient of sucrose is large. The model system used consisted of 4 layers of gel assembled on top of each other (Fig 1). The layers contained different contents of sucrose, but the overall sugar concentration was the same in all samples.
Projet description :
we propose the following ideas to further investigate the potential of taste enhacement in layered systems :
Vary texture of layered system
Vary sensory contrast in layered system</description>

        <description>The object of the project is to develop a noise
emission test for IT keyboard. Actually there is
no standardised method to measure the
keyboard emitted by keyboard. The use of
mechanical excitation will be compared with
human typesetting and a parametric study
carried out. The radiated noise from singularly
pressed keys should then permit to predict the
noise emitted during typesetting.

        <description>Subject: 
1. Design/Development of an analysis tool within Flight Management to consider estimated zero fuel weight accuracy/performance. The analysis would consider Flight Management parameters such as Booked/Estimated To Board passengers, payload variations, unusable fuel against various timelines and the accuracy utilised in Flight Management (for ongoing ZFW prediction) factored against historical trend. Analysis could consider not just flight numbers but departure cities or city pairs, aircraft subtype and registration (individual aircraft performance) trends, domains etc. The analysis should also be output into graphical reports that could be used to assist the operator in planning external to Flight Management. 
2. Design of an integrated analysis tool to validate the accuracy of Aircraft weight and balance data, based on Amadeus? existing external analysis tool, following the data construction phase by the weights engineer and/or database manager. The analysis tool would provide intensive graphical representation of the aircraft subtype data and perform analysis on data integrity, considering potential gross errors, sequential errors, range validation and logical validity. The tool would also potentially cross check Aircraft weight and balance data with business rule content. Ideally, this tool could also generate an IATA AHM565 dataset.</description>

        <description>VEC simulations tools have been migrated from ANSYS to ABAQUS. Today, the whole methodology and criteria have been defined for ANSYS. The aim of the traineeship is to define methodologies and criteria for ABAQUS new reference. The first step of this stage will be to identify the main methodologies concerned by this migration. Topics such as vibration analysis (harmonic and PSD) and thermal shock will be most important cases to be taken into account. The second step will deal with a comparison between the 2 software in order to identify equivalent simulation methods and to determine the best way to translate methodologies. The third step will be focused on the translation of each methodology from ANSYS to ABAQUS. It will be very important to identify the new cards of ABAQUS similar to ANSYS code. As the software are different, it will be necessary to define new ways of methods. To validate the new methodology, it will be necessary to perform coupled simulation with the 2 software for different types of calculation. The fourth and last step will be focused on the criteria definition thanks to tests definition and results. Criteria have to be updated because results will be different. This stage will mix up: calculation software knowledge, simulation methodology, tests definition, methodology capitalization. The final objective of this traineeship will be to replace ANSYS by ABAQUS at the end. It will enable VEC FEA simulation team to be confident in this important migration. On the one hand, ABAQUS methodology has to be defined. On the other hand, these methodologies have to be deepened too and validated.</description>

        <description>Barco develops high-precision medical display systems to bring accuracy and efficiency to a broad range of healthcare disciplines, including radiology, mammography, surgery and clinical review imaging.  Barco's full line of color and grayscale diagnostic displays, display controllers and softcopy Quality Assurance (QA) tools facilitate confident diagnoses while guaranteeing perfect image quality over time and across displays. The Barco MDRC series is a full line of clinical review displays for DICOM-compliant viewing of clinical data and images in every hospital department.  And Barco's 5MP flat panel display systems offer ultimate diagnostic confidence in softcopy mammography applications, and come bundled with high-speed display controllers and user-friendly calibration and QA software.  

In the medical field, it is necessary to conduct studies to objectively evaluate the effectiveness of (new) medical devices.  In the first step, physical measurements of the imaging system can be made, such as MTF and contrast.  However, it is not correct to directly conclude that the diagnostic process on a particular system will be more accurate or better just because the physical measurements are &quot;better&quot;.  Therefore, clinical studies are often conducted with physicians, in order to quantify the effect of improved image quality on diagnostic accuracy.  These studies are called ROC (Receiver Operator Characteristic) studies ((http://radiology.rsna.org/content/229/1/3.full.pdf+html ; http://www.ajronline.org/cgi/content/full/176/4/873 ).
A second approach is to conduct simulations in order to determine the system performance (http://www.ibbt.be/en/project/mevic). 

These types of studies require hundreds of images, with and without disease.  An important step in creating and tuning the study protocol is the classification of images into, for example, 'difficult' and 'easy cases'.  This consists of classifying the image based on features like the compexity of the background, the visibility of the disease (lesions), and other perception issues.

During this internship, you will implement, extend, and validate new and existing medical image classification tools.</description>

        <description> It is an extention of a running project, and with your  
help we could explore more options than we could otherwise finance.  
The product is evaporated milk, or similar emulsions. The dominant  
analysis will be reology, at different temperature up to 120 C.  
Protein modification by cross-linking using transglutaminase or  
deamidation by protein glutaminase. And the fat globule surface can be  
modified by using various surfactants in addition to protein. A bit  
more focus will be needed to make this a topic that you can handle  
properly, but this we will do in the coming weeks, if you are OK with  
the topic.

The alternative would be:
2) Studying the fate of Ca, P and other salts during cheese  
manufacture, which is more or less a continuation of the work of  
Carole Roue, the previous student from Compiegne. Feel free to ask her  
about her work - and also about housing in Deventer or any other  
practicality (if needed we could assist of course).

        <description>The student will be part of a regular project team that is focusing on predevelopment and industrialization of manufacturing processes for new caps and cutters. Different project teams exist with different assignments. For example; new steel developments including process interactions or Accuracy improvement of cutters to enable improved shaving functions. The goal of the internship is to contribute to the development and industrialization of new shavers.

The exact assignment for the student will be formulated in the project team by the lead engineer. An assignment can be for example to investigate the influence of a new steel type on the accuracy of a shaver cutter.

The shaving components have very tight tolerances (micron range), thus measuring technology, spread analyses and spread investigations are a very common practice and statistic methods and tools shall be used extensively by the student.

Because of long lead times of tool manufacturing extensive use of theoretical models (e.g. FEM models) is essential. The use and extension of these models can be part of the assignement.

The internship assignment can be tuned towards both a practical work placement or a final graduation.

        <description>The trainee will have to manage three different projects with the help of an engineer. Different techniques of construction have been developed by the Auroville Earth Institute, and still need to be optimized:

1. Rammed Earth is a technique in which earth is rammed into a formwork, lifted up as the wall goes along. This formwork is currently being optimized and a prototype phase will be starting soon. The trainee will have to follow the making of this prototype, to monitor its performances and follow the industrialization process if the previous phases are successful.

2. Compressed Stabilized Earth Blocks (CSEB) are building units similar to masonry bricks. They are made manually by compressing a mix of soil, sand and cement. The production process is very physically tiring for the workers. Hence a hydraulic press and an automatic mixer are now being developed. The trainee will have to follow the conception, propose solutions, make prototypes and monitor the results. 

3. One of the advantages of working with CSEB is that the blocks are very adhesive between each other, allowing the construction of vaults and domes without support. The Auroville Earth Institute has developed a method of optimization of vaults, but the conception of domes remains quite empirical. The trainee will also have to work on an optimization study of domes by finite elements (Ansys).</description>

        <description>Study and develop a new application that will be a decision support tool for baggage handling agents. When bags are found lost
the tool (either running on mobile device or on a PC) would help the agent deciding what to do with it. The standard flow would be:
- scan the bag tag bar code

        <description>At  nuclear stations in Canada, a large number of labour hours are spent every year packing and unpacking valves.  Rings of valve-packing and their associated components (bushings, lantern rings, washers, etc.) are often extremely difficult to remove and can cause days of unplanned additional work.  These delays often occur during outages and have the potential to extend them, which can be very costly.  
New tools could be designed and manufactured to reduce the amount of work required to remove and install packing and to reduce the possibility of outage extensions due to valve-packing issues.  New tools would also allow for safer valve maintenance work, especially when repacking on valve backseats (sometimes unavoidable).
The idea of developing tooling to improve valve packing work can also be extended to valve inspection and valve repair activities.  Being able to easily and efficiently repair valve stems, for example, will save the stations time and money.
The scope of work for the project consists of assessing the nuclear station needs (meeting and brainstorming with station packing specialists and maintenance personnel), surveying the market for new ideas and existing products, outlining design requirements, purchasing, developing, designing and fabricating the tools and organizing them into a specific tool kit.
The toolkit would include inspection tools and techniques. Tools might include (but not limited to):
1. In-situ packing removal tools (can be used when valve is backseated),
2. Packing removal tools and techniques,
3. Stem repair (scores, pits, etc.),
4. Measuring devices,
5. Packing preforming tool,
The student will work under the supervision of an engineer (valve packing specialist).  The student will be associated to all aspects of this project and will be given a high-level of responsibility and autonomy.

        <description>Goal:
There is need for a standard scanning device that is able to scan skin samples or living humans. The scanning should be a combination of 'mechanical' and 'optical scanning'. Preferably this device is a handheld device, but could also be a larger device.
Impression:
This project can include: Mechanical design of the (handheld) scanner:
o Slow moving parts in three directions by means of actuators
o Fast moving mirrors for fast scanning in two directions
o Interface where samples can be scanned in different orientations by means of manual adjusters
o Interface where a part of the skin of living humans can be scanned Electronics for driving the actuators and reading out the sensor data (e.g. A/D converter) Software for controlling the scanner, analyzing the data (build up of the pictures) and the user interface.</description>

        <description>

Eutectic Freeze Crystallization (EFC) offers an alternative to conventional separation techniques for recovering soluble inorganic materials from industrial processes and aqueous waste streams. Around the eutectic temperature both pure salt and ice crystals can be simultaneously regained as valuable products. Theoretically 100% yield and up to 70% energy saving can be achieved compared to triple stage evaporative and cooling crystallization. Separation of ice and salt products takes place inside the crystallizer, based on their density difference. The process is ecologic as no addition of other chemicals is required. By means EFC technology, a waste industrial aqueous stream can be turned into two valuable products: clean water (ready for reuse in the process) and a salt (as a marketable product) with high purity.

Research aim
The main goal of this assignment is to test different aqueous streams for industrial applications. These tests will be performed within different size and type crystallizers. The industrial stream will be investigated for:  
- 	defining the residence times in the EFC crystallizer
- 	finding the optimum crystal sizes of ice and salt crystals 
- 	measuring the quality of the products
- 	calculating the heat and mass balance of the whole process
- 	making the economical evaluation of the process

        <description>Company activities and website
The Performance Engineering Lab is a university based research lab with a commercial focus: its primary objective is to develop innovative solutions to real-world problems, thus creating value and identify ways to leverage this value such as licensing of patents or formation of start-ups. The lab has extensive industrial contacts and is working on commercialising its outputs in conjunction with partner organizations. 
The lab has two main areas of activity: (1) mobile &amp; multimedia communications systems and (2) distributed computing systems. This project falls into the former.
Within the area of mobile and multimedia communications, the group is working on projects including:
- 	Development of P2P solution for Video on Demand in IPTV;
- 	Development of a multi-radio WiFi based mesh solution for indoor deployments
- 	Development of a mobile applications and networking solutions for 3G networks
The group's website is at http://pel.ucd.ie/ 
Project Title
Development of scalable, high performance, software-based solution to off-load 3G access networks.
Tasks to accomplish (subject of the internship)
Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) are face today with a critical dilemma entailed by the tremendous success of mobile Internet traffic with estimated 5000% traffic volumes growth over the past 3 years. The fast adoption of smart phones by consumers has indeed created a tremendous pressure on the 3G access networks that were never designed to support huge data traffic. This situation will only worsen with the provisioning of multimedia-rich services for mobile users. The MNO are faced with a growing costumers dissatisfaction due to increased network access infrastructures saturation and very costly network access upgrades that will further squeeze their profit margins. 
In this context, our team aims to develop solutions to seamlessly off-load 3G access networks by taking advantage of ubiquiteous WiFi networks. The objective is to smoothly divert traffic over different networking infrastructures while supporting end-users mobility. The team has an advanced knowledge of multi-homing protocols with a significant experience in prototyping. 
The project will consist in developing a multi-homing, multi-streaming protocol to allow 3G mobile devices to split original TCP (resp. UDP) flows into multiple sub-streams to be carried by SCTP protocol through different wireless interfaces (e.g., 3G, WiFi, Bluetooth, etc.). The multiple SCTP streams are sent through diverse paths to a gateway that multiplex the streams into the original TCP (resp. UDP). Most of the intelligence in the system lies with the gateway.
This project will be carried out in collaboration with a Dublin-based mobile Internet startup, with an objective to develop an initial proof-of-concept that will be thereafter evolved to a carrier-grade product. 


The tasks to be completed are summarised below:
Integration of the SCTP-based Shim layer in the Android platform
o	Work with the Shim layer. Shim layer is available in FreeBSD kernel (4.10 and 7.0). This package will be extended to satisfy the targeted business use case. 
o	Improve the Shim layer to seamlessly support UDP traffic
Development of the multi-homing gateway capabilities
o	Work on NAT-PT library available in Linux to support SCTP-to-TCP protocols conversion with seamless ports translations
o	Develop over-the-top algorithms to supervise the data multiplexing, and load balancing over the different SCTP streams carrying data of the same session.
Develop the support of multi-streaming and mobility support
o	Extending the  SCTP protocol to support multi-streaming capabilities
o	Develop integrated in-bound signalling mechanisms to support the mobility of handsets in a multi-homing, multi-streaming context.  

Successful interns can stay involved with the mobile Internet start-up. Lead engineer positions will be available if the project is successful.

        <description>The tuned vibration absorber (TVA) is a well-established vibration control device, which can be used to suppress a troublesome resonance or to attenuate the vibration of a structure at a particular forcing frequency. Even though such a device may have different shapes it acts like a spring-mass system. Two of the drawbacks of such a device, however, are that it can detune during operation because of changes in forcing frequency, or that there may be differences between the designed and in-situ behaviour.
A variable stiffness element can be used to maintain a tuned condition so that the natural frequency of the absorber can be adjusted with time. This can be achieved in a number of ways for example by altering the pressure in a set of rubber bellows, altering the gap between two beams forming a compound cantilever beam, adjusting the number of active coils in a coil spring or changing the temperature of a shape memory alloy element. However, such devices have not found yet industrial applications because of their limited tuning range or because of their limited tuning speed. 
The aim of the project is to design and build a novel variable stiffness TVA that exploits structures that have different stiffness values along two orthogonal axes. The rotation of such structures permits then to tune the absorber to the desired frequency.  In order to automatically tune the vibration absorber, a control strategy that uses the displacement of the base and mass of the TVA could be employed.</description>

        <description>The rehabilitation and maintenance management of the subsurface urban infrastructure distribution systems raise a major challenge of implementing innovative trenchless solutions.

The prime purpose is to avoid interference management costs of utility lifelines relocation for the trenching operations in the rehabilitation and maintenance of the city water supply systems. Further, replacement of traditional trenching operations with trenchless solutions has major societal, environmental, and mobility impacts on the quality of life in the urban centers. Local Governments have devised different strategies and regulatory framework for integrating the societal and environmental costs in the selection of alternative solutions for specific projects. However the selection and deployment of such added value based strategies are greatly dependent on the institutional infrastructure of the local governments and the extent of their cooperation with the major infrastructure share holders and, in particular, the urban utilities. 

The Urban Utility Center has undertaken a city wide initiative with the City Agencies and the NY utilities for the assessment of trenchless solutions for the water-mains rehabilitation   and maintenance. This involves review of current technology assessment practice in terms of regulatory framework, integrating social and environmental impacts evaluation strategies in the selection of alternative solutions for the projects, as well as technical feasibility through laboratory and site demonstration projects. The student will participate in the work of the research team. 

En français: 
Le service de rhéabilitation et de maintenance des systèmes de distribution des infrastructures urbaines recherche des solutions innovantes pour une irrigation sans tranchée.

Le premier objectif est d'éviter les coûts de déplacement des systèmes d'irrigation actuel pour le réapprovisionnement en eau de la ville. Ensuite, le remplacement de ces systèmes actuels par des sytèmes sans fossés aura des impacts sociaux, environnementaux et sur la mobilité qui affecteront la qualité de vie en centre ville.

Les gouvernements locaux ont imaginé différentes stratégies pour évaluer les couts environnementaux et sociaux. Cependant ces stratégies dépendent beaucoup des infrastructures institutionnelles des gouvernements locaux.

Urban Utility Center entreprend l'évaluation des impacts des systèmes sans tranchées dans les grandes villes avec les agences de la ville de NY et les Utiltés New Yorkaises. Cela implique de revoir les technologies actuelles que l'on pratique  pour évaluer les impacts environnementaux et sociaux ainsi que les études de faisabilités techniques à travers des laboratoire et des projets de demonstration.

        <description>In my opinion, the best option is to focus your work experience in supporting us to achieve a better configuration of our products and market. There is a universal challenge of those dealing with metrology: the difficulty to show the value of our services and competences, because the companies see metrology more as a cost than an investment.
We have some ideas that should be put into practice before the second semester of 2011.  
At the end of the project we expect:

-Better understanding of the strategies that are applied worldwide;
-Better understanding of the market niches that demand reference metrology services for product development and manufacturing process control and improvement;
-Improved definitions of our metrology products, including measurement and calibration services, training and consultancy;
-Improved marketing strategy, including a draft of the printed materials we will use to go into the market.

In spite the project is clearly in the context of a bussiness plan, there are technical issues that you shall learn to do a good job.
You will receive also some metrology and quality assurance education in the context of the regular training courses we offer to industry.
It will be necessary to write reports along this project, but in this case we could be more permissive because it will be &quot;just for our eyes&quot;. So you will practice also your portuguese.
Of course, you will be not alone in this project. In the beginnings you will work on focused deliverables, under supervision and suported by a specialist in business plans, our sales manager and our metrology specialists. We expect that you will be able to do a more autonomous work as the time passess.</description>

        <description>Outdoor static engine tests are regularly performed to measure the noise emission from new engine designs. In that context acoustic arrays are frequently used to investigate engine source characteristics, identify the location of unexpected sources and to separate out the contribution of the individual noise sources as a function of direction and frequency (source breakdowns) which cannot be achieved by spectral analysis alone. The noise generated by the engine is generally split into the inlet fan noise, jet noise and the exhaust fan noise. The acoustic arrays consists of a large number of microphones distributed along an arc or a line near the engine. Quantitative source breakdowns are of considerable use for engine manufacturers but the required post-processing of the phased array data involves additional assumptions and/or modelling along with numerical issues which can make it quite challenging to design a robust process.

The aim of this project will be to assess source identification techniques using phased arrays and to clarify the influence of various assumptions on the accuracy of the source breakdown. To achieve this, simulated sound fields will be used to test the method in various situations. These simulations will be obtained from numerical simulations using finite element software. The issues that will be explored include the position of the array relative to the engine (for instance if being in the acoustic far field is important), the nature of the noise source, the influence of acoustic treatments with the objective to understand how these parameters influence the performance of the source identification in practice. In addition experimental data from an engine test will be available to apply the method to a real-world example.

This project will provide the student with training in the following areas:
- Using a commercial code for aero-acoustics simulations (Actran TM).
- Modelling of acoustic arrays.
- General understanding of aircraft noise issues.

The project will take place within the Rolls-Royce University Technology Center in gas turbine noise at the Institute of Sound and Vibration Research.

Required background: acoustics, Matlab.
Skills: theoretical 50%, numerical 50%

        <description>Applicaation of nanofiltration of reverse osmosis results in a concentrate stream for which a desstination has to be found. In the vast majority of cases this concentrate is discharged to the surface water but in the present legislation these streams are considered as an independant source of contaminants. The ideal solution is a zero liquid discharge concept in which only solid waste results, which can be reused or stored as chemical waste in the sustainable way.
In this project we aim to increase the recovery of a system with a primary NF stage and a secondary RO stage to as high as possible in order to approach as closely as possible to the ZI.D concept.
As these high recoveries silica scaling seems to be the limiting parameter. Silica scaling occurs when the dissolved silica exceeds its solubility limit and when that happens it starts to deposit in the membrane. Once the silica is deposed it is very difficult to remove it.
In order to prevent silica scaling, two options will be investigated , either to design a crystallizer to remove the silica from the NF concentrate and to develop a dedicated antiscalant for silica. Itis expected that a high recovery can be readched without scaling the membrane when using theses processes.
The student will try to solve the problem at lab scale in order to apply it later to the pilot plant. the assignment will consist on experimental work concerning the silica crystallization and testing dedicated silica antiscalants. </description>

        <description>Seismic waves are waves that travel through the Earth, for instance as the result of a tectonic earthquake or of an explosion. There are two main types of seismic waves, body and surface waves. Body waves, which travel through the interior of the Earth, can be distinguished in P and S waves. P waves are longitudinal or pressure waves; in this case the ground is alternately compressed and dilated in the direction of propagation. S waves are transverse or shear waves; in this case the ground is deformed perpendicularly to the direction of propagation. Their speed is about 60% of that of P waves. Surface waves travel just under the Earth's surface. They travel more slowly than body waves but are usually characterised by larger amplitudes.

Seismic waves can be generated exciting the ground free surface with shakers. The vibration of the free surface can then be analysed, with a methodology similar to that employed in sonar, in order to locate buried object. Seismic location of buried object can be used for environmental, archaeological and defence application. It can be used to locate ditches, pipes, archaeological remains and buried unexploded bombs. The effectiveness of such seismic location lays on understanding how seismic waves reflect and interact between them. A planar finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) has been partially set up and preliminary tested. FDTD analyses permit to calculate the excitation in the body at different time steps. The student will be asked to setup an FDTD software and to validate it. The student will be asked to carry out a parametric study of the system considering different excitations, different buried objects (materials and shapes) and the presence of multiple objects. Post-processing of the data will also be considered.

        <description>The customer management application is part of the high end Amadeus Altea Suite. It allows airlines to check-in passengers and baggage in a smooth and efficient way valuing the customer experience and maximising the airline's revenue. When you check in certain items, some airlines attach a Limited Release Tag (LRT). Such items might include musical instruments, sporting equipment (bikes and surfboards etc) or even a damaged bag. These items are checked in on a limited release basis, where a carrier will attempt to remove its liability should the baggage be lost or damaged. The aim of this internship is to design a mean to allow a check-in agent to take a picture of the damaged bag and store it in the customer management application. The internship will have to take into consideration the low level of the infrastructure available at airports as well as building a prototype to demonstrate the proof of concept.</description>

        <description>Presently companies can no longer compete simply on technology, mainly because many are facing competitors that are equal in technical expertise.  It is no longer sufficient for a product to function properly, be usable and efficient or have aesthetic appeal, but it also has to provide positive emotional responses such as pleasure, inspiration, desire, positive surprise, etc. Design for emotions (DFe) is being seen as a determining factor in the success of a product and pleasurable products as a key contributor to the competitive advantage of a firm.  Despite the advancements made in CAD systems, designers lack Design for Emotion support whilst they are modelling their concepts in a CAD system. 

PROJECT OBJECTIVE(S)
From an academic perspective, the goals are therefore to:

'	carry out a literature review on the state-of-the-art Design for Emotion support
'	develop a framework supporting real-time guidance to designers to enhance the emotional content of a product, directly from the aesthetic curves and other features of the evolving CAD model
'	implement and test a proof-of-concept tool based on the framework developed
'	evaluate the underlying principle of the tool from a practical point of view

Expected Project Deliverables

'Deliverable 1: A literature review on the state-of-the-art technologies supporting DFe

'Deliverable 2: A taxonomy of product form features (e.g. aesthetic curves) and their impact on the product users' emotions

'Deliverable 2: A framework as  described above

'Deliverable 3: A basic proof-of-concept tool 

'Deliverable 4: Evaluation of the tool

        <description>Background:
A gel is a dispersion of molecules or particles forming a network inside a fluid. In the case of
Aerogels, the fluid containing the 3D'cross network of particles is air (see Figure 1 and Figure 2).
Due to its nanoparticles network structure Aerogels are a high sound and heat insulating material
with low density, high specific surface area and little light scattering. This makes this material
interesting as a construction material, optical and acoustic devices, cosmetics, coating materials,
pharmaceutical and adsorbents.
Figure 1: Scheme of particles network in a gel
Figure 2: Silica Aerogel
Recently a new method was found to prepare calcium carbonate aerogel by controlled hydrolysis
of calciumdi (methylcarbonate) by the reaction of carbon dioxide with calcium oxide in methanol,
and then a supercritical drying with carbon dioxide to produce CaCO3 aerogel.
The Project:
The aims of this project are to optimize the different parameters at lab scale production of CaCO3
aerogel, to study the influence of different additives in the formation of the calcium carbonate
nanostructure forming the gel and thus the influence on the aerogel properties.
We are looking for motivated students with chemical, chemical engineering, or physical
background for a research assignment on this topic.
The assignment will consist on experimental work concerning lab scale CaCO3 aerogel production
and testing.

As of today, there is no open hole tractor tool, neither from Schlumberger nor from competitors. An open hole tractor is used to convey logging tools in highly deviated and horizontal wells without TLC (drill pipe conveyance). Several attempts have been made since 2002 without or limited success.

Deliverables:
IP - Patent search, technology and competition watch, consolidate ideas and submit patent memo
Field test - Ask packer clients to inflate packer (IPCF-PA-700) in a well and pull up to 5,000 lbf
Test preparation  - Design and build test track, design and build mock-up
Testing - Tractor successfully in a 8.5in casing for 100ft and apply as much load as possible. Take a video to promote the innovation.
Documentation - Follow general PLMP incl. risk analysis and criterion of success</description>

        <description>Rubber diaphragms are being used in a downhole tool to compensate for the change in volume of oil under varying pressure and temperature combinations. We wish to validate the lifetime of diaphragms made from different materials under simulated downhole conditions.
The project workflow is expected to be as follows '&quot;
1)Capture of project requirements and objectives
2)Propose, develop and write a test plan
3) Design and build suitable test apparatus
4) Run tests on different diaphragm materials with varying operating conditions
5)Perform failure analysis on diaphragms and determine design parameters of importance
6)Make recommendations on best design and material for diaphragms
The design of the test apparatus will be within the scope of this project, it would require applying a varying pressure of just a few psi across the diaphragm while being exposed to drilling fluids at varying temperatures. After several thousand cycles of pressure, the part will be checked for potential damages and failures.</description>

        <description>The transport of multimedia web traffic on mobile devices provides
interesting research problems in transport protocols. However, client
and server applications still need to be adapted to benefit from potential
enhancements, which hinders the experimental evaluation of these
improvements. A small footprint, modularly extensible HTTP proxy
can mitigate this limitation by transparently allowing the providing of
new enhancements to legacy web clients and servers. The candidate's
project will consist of developing software for Unix platforms, such as
the Android mobile operating system, providing the basic HTTP proxy
functionality. The candidate will also develop support modules
necessary to experiment or demonstrate current research work.</description>

We will study the strongly nonlinear beating phenomena caused by the local nonlinearity due to nonlinear coupling between vibration modes.Then we will try to perform system identification of the nonlinear dynamics using a combination of techniques, such as wavelet transforms, empirical mode decomposition and Hilbert transforms.
After the computational study, we will try to construct an experimental ficture in order to reproduce and verify the computation results.</description>

        <description>The aim of the internship is to deliver the 2nd phase of a prototype Baggage Handling System ( BHS ).
People fly with baggage every day, and there is a lot happening in the background to ensure that the passenger's baggage is not lost and is flown with him.
Baggage Security, Tracking, providing accurate Loading information about a Bag, actually loading the Bag are some of the functions that a Baggage Handling System provides.
Accurate information about where a Bag is loaded on an aircraft in return allows more accurate Aircraft Trim and Fuel calculations for a Departure Control System ( DCS )
Lost Baggage, inaccurate Aircraft Trim calculations all have a financial impact on airlines, e.g. Lost Baggage costs the industry about 2.5 billion USD annually ( as per IATA figures in 2009 )
There is constant real time interaction between a DCS and a BHS to :
- exchange information about Bags accepted for passengers
- get the last known location of the Bags so they can be tracked
- use the most accurate information about the Bags and their loading in processing the flight
The aim of this internship is to extend a basic BHS prototype and enhance the functionality currently offered via it.
The issues and requirements for which a solution has to be designed are real industry requirements, with the potential to design a solution which could be adopted across the airline industry.

        <description>1.    Introduction
The student will join the cylinder design team.  This is a small team currently working on a number of design improvement and cost down projects related to the CS telescopic cylinder product.
Typically these projects will use Solidworks 2010, with Cosmos FEA back up where required.  A small but versatile test lab is available to verify design proposals when necessary.
The design team is very small (totally 4) so there is a lot of opportunity to have a real impact on this product design.
2.    Projects
The student will work on some of the projects listed below depending on the priority of the day.
a.    CS hoist catalogue
Using the results of cylinder load tests currently underway, define a new approach to load calculations using existing software.  Then apply these results to the complete CS hoist range such that a catalogue (already 75% completed) can be finished and published.
b.    Web site information
Using the new definition of cylinder capability defined above (a), create new marketing drawings for the full range using a configurator tool within Solidworks and upload these to www.edbro.com.
Similarly, develop a procedure for creating 3D surface models of cylinders for upload to the website.
c.    Value analysis of C series cylinder
Using formal VA/VE analysis tools, assess the cost build-up of the most popular cylinder designs.  Then challenge the design piece by piece and look for better solutions for lower cost and/or better function.
d.    Outer cover redesign
Part of the cylinder is known as the outer cover.  A draft project proposal has been approved to save cost and weight.  This must now be implemented but some design challenges remain and will need to be assessed by modelling, FEA and testing.  
e.    B2 implementation
B2 is a 3 year programme to develop a new tube fabrication design to save cost by exploiting additional capabilities of new capital equipment now being installed in the factory.  2012 will see the start of the formal implementation of these designs which will require new tube designs within Solidworks and careful implementation planning via our ERP system.

        <description>Amadeus Departure Control System (DCS) is at the heart of airlines operations at the airport. Many different airlines systems interact with DCS.

Post flight departure, DCS generates several data warehouse files that are sent to feed the airlines:
- FM data warehouse: containing all flight related items
- CM data warehouse: containing all passenger, baggage and seatmap information Some airlines do not have IT department to build application that would allow them to look at the content of the files, hence have to request Amadeus to extract some data.
The goal of this internship is to develop portable and standalone application that will allow airlines to browse content of both FM and CM data warehouse files. A second part of this internship will be for this application to have a module to import data warehouse files into a database. Choice of the database will have to be done as part of the internship. It should be portable and installation should take care of all database setup.

        <description>This internship is to develop a tractor tool based on an existing reciprocal drive systems combined with packer technology from the fluid sampling department as centralizing and gripping elements.
A downhole tractor tool is used to convey logging tools of the oil and gas indstry in highly deviated and horizontal wells without drill pipe conveyance.

The packer tractor project has already been funded as an internship in 2011. Open issues:
1. Due to budget limitations, the hydraulic control circuit has been substituted by pneumatic components.
2. To increase packer life and reduce friction, bowsprings with gripping pads need to be installed around the inflatable elements.
3. Wireline cables and coiled tubing tubes tend to stretch elastically and pull back the tool string when none of the gripping elements is 'anchoring' the current position. An improved hydraulic circuit has to be developed and implemented.

Deliverables:
- On-site test
Tractor successfully in a 8.5in casing for 100ft and apply as much load as possible (Dec 2012).

- Documentation
Project documentation in internal project management database. 

- Presentation
Presentation of the outcome of the project including a demo vido for further project funding.

The aim of the internship is to deliver the 2nd phase of a prototype Baggage Handling System ( BHS ).

People fly with baggage every day, and there is a lot happening in the background to ensure that the passenger's baggage is not lost and is flown with him.
Baggage Security, Tracking, providing accurate Loading information about a Bag, actually loading the Bag are some of the functions that a Baggage Handling System provides.
Accurate information about where a Bag is loaded on an aircraft in return allows more accurate Aircraft Trim and Fuel calculations for a Departure Control System ( DCS )

Lost Baggage, inaccurate Aircraft Trim calculations all have a financial impact on airlines, e.g. Lost Baggage costs the industry about 2.5 billion USD annually ( as per IATA figures in 2009 )

There is constant real time interaction between a DCS and a BHS to :
- exchange information about Bags accepted for passengers
- get the last known location of the Bags so they can be tracked
- use the most accurate information about the Bags and their loading in processing the flight

The aim of this internship is to extend a basic BHS prototype and enhance the functionality currently offered via it.
The issues and requirements for which a solution has to be designed are real industry requirements, with the potential to design a solution which could be adopted across the airline industry.

Required skills:	Good analytical and design skills.
Personal required skills:	Interested in UI design / animation.
Ability to integrate within a team, good communication skills. 
 
Programming Skills:	C++,C#  (mobile application),HTML
Databases:	SQL, Oracle
Communication Protocols &amp; Standards:	SOAP
Operating Systems:	 Windows, Unix

        <description>Exoskeletons are a new class of articulated mechanical systems whose performance is realized while in intimate contact with the human user. The overall performance depends on many factors including selection of architecture, device, parameters and the nature of the coupling to the human, offering numerous challenges to design-evaluation and refinement. In this research, we discuss merger of techniques from the musculoskeletal analysis and simulation-based design to study and analyze the performance of such exoskeletons. A representative example of a simplified exoskeleton interacting with and assisting the human arm will be used to examine the principal ideas. Different case-scenarios will be  developed and examined with quantitative performance measures to evaluate the effectiveness of the design to reduce muscle loading and allow for design refinement . </description>

        <description>In the framework of the Airbus acoustics department activities, the in-flight aircraft external noise prediction has an important place to ensure the ability to apprehend aircraft noise levels and to emphasize the most critical acoustics parts to be tackled with.
During the last flight test campaign, singles microphones for certification and a ground microphones array used for acoustic localization were installed to measure far-field noise. Based on these measurements, this internship is concentrated on the improvement of the noise prediction for a turbo-propeller aircraft in take-off conditions and understanding the noise sources repartition within the total aircraft noise spectra.

Objectives
#	Analysis of turbo-propeller aircraft far field noise measurements in take-off configurations.
#	Process localization maps of the ground microphone array and analysis of the results.
#	Understanding and analysing the noise source repartition, i.e. between propeller noise, engine noise sources and airframe noise.
#	Comparison between measurements and aircraft far field noise predictions in take-off conditions.
#	Elaborate improvement in the transposed into-flight aircraft noise predictions for these cases
#	Global objective is to improve Airbus knowledge on the noise level of the propeller, the engine noise and the airframe noise of a turbo-propeller aircraft in take-off configuration and to improve our prediction capability for these cases.

        <description>Plant Holzhausen (first period)
The first step of the internship is planned as a basic investigation on the chemical concentrations in the different baths and their changes during the periods. In the next step it should be investigated how reductions in the concentration have an impact on the building up of the lubrication layer. Therefore also the dipping time can be varied, as the surface treatment is not
a bottles-neck in the plant.
Main tasks:
- Basic study on the chemical concentration in the baths for tube preparation
- Impact of changes of the concentrations and dipping times
- Impact of a reduction of the concentrations on environmental aspects and cost reduction
A second investigation is planned about the effects of a temperature reduction in the baths. Therefore a lab bath will be used to find out, how much the temperature can be reduced without having an impact on the surface treatment. In this case the main task will be, how much energy can be saved in this process by reducing the temperature in the different baths.

Plant Bielefeld-Brackwede
The investigations in this plant and period also deal with the surface treatment for the tube preparation. The chemical concentrations and their consumptions in the baths are the main process parameter to investigate into. Therefore the concentrations have to be measured during several periods and will be the basis for a strategy to keep the concentration as constant as possible to keep a stabile process result.
In a second step the growth of the lubrication layer will be observed for different tube dimensions and steel grades. The target is to find out, if different kinds of tubes show a different behavior on the growth of the layer and to finally optimize the dipping times for different tubes. So the overall consumption of chemicals can be reduced and capacity of the surface treatment workshop can be increased
Main tasks:
- Measurement of the consumption of chemicals
- Defining strategies to keep a constant level of concentration
- Investigation into the growth of the layer
- Defining strategies to optimize the dipping times</description>

Context:
Metal nanoparticles under visible electromagnetic radiation are able to act as efficient heat nanoscale sources due to a series of internal energy exchanges. This conversion process can be employed in various fields, specifically in the biomedical domain where nanoparticles having controlled shapes are stacked into dense assemblies around biological objects in order to induce local heating of the latter.
Thanks to a partnership linking physicists, chemists and biologists we develop the study of nanohybrids associating gold nanoparticles and thermosensitive polymers. The temperature increase induced locally by photothermal effect results in the change of the polymer conformation, followed by the nanoparticle auto-assembling in the medium. One of our objectives is to exploit this mechanism for targeting biological cells, then for hyperthermia. 

Aim of the research internship:
The global project is dedicated to the demonstration of the photo-induced targeting of biological cells and cancer tumors and to the improvement of hyperthermia effect thanks to the use of nanohybrids. Usually, in these biomedical applications, a continuous laser irradiation is used. We will exploit the possibility of controlling the heating characteristics by using a pulsed irradiation. For this, we benefit an amplified laser delivering ultrashort pulses.

Tasks to be achieved by the student:
- Definition of a model and a protocol for studying biological cell targeting 
- Toxicity test of the nano-hybrids
- Demonstration of the improvement of cell targeting by nanohybrids under light irradiation
- Measurement of cell survival in the presence of nanoparticles for different laser irradiation conditions

The internship will take place in LCP, Orsay, in close partnership with both LPQM-ECP and a group of the MSSMat laboratory, both in Ecole Centrale Paris. Beyond the internship work itself, the project represents a significant issue in a multidisciplinary environment.

        <description>In this project we aim at developing cheeses that give the sensory properties of full fat cheese but have totally different protein, fat or water content. In order to do so we have to alter the cheese microstructure such that changes in compositions are counteracted. Many processing options for changing microstructure in cheese are available, which one to choose?
 
To guide our search for new microstructures we build computer models which allow us to simulate the mechanical response of a wide variety of microstructures to different deformations. The models have experimental data as input and the simulations are validated with experiments as well. These experiments consist of a careful selection and combination of (micro)rheology, microscopy and making new microstructures in the lab.
 
To have access to the latest techniques and insights in material modelling, characterisation techniques, and structure formation processes we have set up a collaboration with the Polymer Technology department of TU Eindhoven and the Food Process Engineering department of Wageningen University. The total programme consists of 4 PhD students and has a duration of five years. 
 
Your role will be to contribute to further sophistication of the models by carrying out one or more of the subprojects below (depending on your interests and capabilities).
 
- image and measure deformations in cheese and cheese like structure on a micronscale
- couple waterbinding behaviour to cheese rheological properties
- obtain constitutive (=material) parameters from cheese through Large strain Amplitude Oscillating Shear experiments
- built new model structures in the lab for validating simulations
 
In all cases this will not only mean setting up and performing experiments but also being responsible for further improvement of the underlying technigues as well.

        <description>Beyond the development of new insulation solutions, the task of the R&amp;D center situated in Rantigny is to give a technical support to all Isover plants through the world.
One part of the process concerns the polymerization of glass wool products which is done in dedicated equipment working with ventilated hot air called curing oven. Those equipments are installed in all plants under different technological versions due to different needs depending on countries and markets. Those equipments need a close follow up with maintenance which brings a lot of questions to us from all plants concerning mechanics, process and safety.

The goal of this training will be:

-To create a database with all questions which plants could have,
-To bring clear, precise and illustrated answers based on feedbacks from plants and specialists,
-To organize the whole document to make it easy and rapid to use.
The whole document must be written in English and will be available to all plants on internal network.
Some business trips to different Isover plants may occur during the training

        <description>Aerospace structural systems experience a broad spectrum of environmental and operational loads. Severe and/or prolonged load exposures may trigger the damage accumulation process even in recently deployed structures. The process of implementing a strategy of damage detection for engineering structures is referred to as structural health monitoring (SHM).
SHM is an emerging technology to automate the inspection process to assess and evaluate the health condition of structures in real-time or at specified time intervals. It is often related to the presence and location of damages. SHM systems for smart structures (a smart structure has built-in sensors and actuators.) may automatically process data, assess structural condition, and signal the need for human intervention.
SHM technology involves multidisciplinary fields ranging from material, structure, signal processing, data mining, fracture mechanics, fatigue life analysis and more. It aims to detect, localize and evaluate the severity of damages. The improvement of the integrity assessment of in-service structures is the main challenge that motivates the use of SHM systems. As structures age, or undergo fatigue loads, the possibility of failure increases, which may significantly jeopardize operation and safety without timely awareness. Most of SHM methods are based on the interpretation of signals generated by the sensors of the smart structure. The greatest challenge is to ascertain what changes are sought in the signals after the presence of damage. Features extraction is therefore a key step in the processing of signal sensor for SHM. 
Composite materials offer good resistance to fatigue and corrosion and a good adaptability of their mechanical properties to the specific requirements during their use. However, the intensive use of this kind of material as a primary structural element, in particular in the field of the civil aviation, remains limited by the requirement of proving its reliability, given that the presence of defects can severely degrade its mechanical properties 
The guided Lamb wave is widely acknowledged as one of the most encouraging tools for quantitative identification of damage in composite structures, with a high susceptibility to interference on a propagation path, e.g. damage or a boundary, Lamb waves can travel over a long distance even in materials with a high attenuation ratio, such as carbon fibre-reinforced composites, and thus a broad area can be quickly examined. The entire thickness of the laminate can also be interrogated by various Lamb modes, affording the possibility of detecting internal damage as well as that on surface. However, the propagation of Lamb waves in anisotropic viscoelastic media is notoriously complicated. With a very fast velocity, waves reflected from boundaries may easily conceal damage-scattered components in the signals.
The aim of the work is to study Lamb wave propagation and interaction with various damages in actual specific aerospace composite structures. These structures are built in with piezoelectric transducer as actuators and sensors. Piezoelectric elements deliver excellent performance in Lamb wave generation and acquisition, and are particularly suitable for integration into a host structure as an in-situ generator/sensor. 
The applicant has to study Lamb wave propagations in composite structures. He will be involved in the construction and the assembly of the test bench. He will conducte simulations and experimentations on healthy and damaged structures. The results will present . Periodic presentations and reports (in English) on the progress of work will be required showing the effectiveness of guided LAMB waves in detecting and localizing damages on these composite structures

        <description>The focus of my laboratory is developing underwater robots which can operate in dynamic shallow water environments.  My research group takes inspiration from biology to design mechanisms and behaviors for underwater vehicles. 

 I am currently engaged in two projects which require creative thinking about prototype manufacturing with rigid and flexible materials. The first project is to develop a process to make different wing sections which have a rigid leading edge, a flexible trailing edge, and which contain array of embedded pressure sensors.   The second project is similar, except that in this case we hope to create an entire robot body with a mixture of rigid and flexible structures.

The role of the intern will be to design and test prototype manufacturing processes for semi-flexible wing and body construction:
'	Selection of mold manufacturing process and materials.
'	Design and specification of molds.
'	Development and testing of repeatable molding procedure, including procedure for embedding pressure sensor(s) in wing and body sections.
'	Analysis of deflection of rigid sections of wings under static and dynamic loading.
'	Fatigue analysis for rigid sections of wings undergoing large oscillatory loads.
'	Validation of prototype component performance in conjunction with graduate students performing in water experiments.

        <description>We are looking for a student who will be willing to work with us in the topic of interactive 
ray   casting   DVR   based   medical   image   visualization,   using   visual   attention   based enhancement.
 
Tareas: The  student  will  participate  under  supervision  in  the  development  of  some 
proofs  of  concept  that  demonstrate  the  feasibility  of  the  described  approaches.  This  will  involve handling of CT images, use of eye tracking systems and design and implementation of  specific visualization methods (C++, VTK, ITK, OpenGL, GLSL).
 
Objetivos: Take  part  in  the  development  of  an  application  which  gathers  the  user's  focus  of  visual attention  using  an  eye  tracker,  and  then  uses  this  information  to  guide  the  rendering parameters of the ray casting DVR interactively. The application will be able to highlight those regions and data which are more interesting to the user. As the focus of  attention  changes,  the  visualization  should  evolve  appropriately too, in real time. The main challenges include the way in which visual attention  is  modeled,  and  to  achieve  a  meaningful,  accurate  and coherent visualization of the interesting data while fading away the rest, and still keeping enough visual information left so the user has some context information to change his focus of interest. It must be an  interactive  process,  so  the  computational  performance  of  the algorithms  is  crucial.  Therefore,  most  of  the  procedures  will  be 
performed in the GPU. 
As a secondary objective, the direct practical applications of the visual attention modeling will be  explored.  This  includes  the  didactic  application  for  novel  radiologists  to  learn  the  most effective and efficient medical image reviewing methods and supportive application to avoid the accidental skipping of regions by the professional. This task will involve the definition and implementation of: 
'    Storage and representation methods for visual attention in medical images. 
'    New visualization enhancement solutions for volume rendering

        <description>Advances in bioengineering are allowing the development of various complex microfluidic biochips that can reproduce the interactions between different organs such as the liver, kidneys, intestines or the lungs. In previous project, we developed protocols allowing cell cultures in microfluidic biochips. Data analysis from transcriptomic and proteomic profiles highlighted a modulation of oxidative stress via the Nrf 2 pathway. In parallel a mathematical model describing the glutathione depletion and the Nrf2 modulation has been implemented in a systems biologyframework. In this project, we propose to run and to apply the mathematical model to analyse the biochip data.

        <description>The German Aerospace Center (German: Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt e.V.), abbreviated DLR, is the national center for aerospace, energy and transportation research of the Federal Republic of Germany. The SART (Space Launcher Systems Analysis) group is responsible within DLR for the study and the development of new proposals for expendable launch vehicles.  In that matter, the group is focusing on some innovative proposals for the Ariane 6.http://www.dlr.de/irs/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-6639/11294_read-25975/

In the preliminary design phase of rocket launchers a fast and simple tool is needed for structural analysis. For this purpose the Launcher Structural Analysis Program (LSAP) has been developed within SART. LSAP is able to perform preliminary structural analysis for a wide range of rocket launcher configurations and may also be used for aircraft fuselage structures. LSAP idealizes the launcher as a 1-D bending beam and uses analytical relationships for structural analysis. In the current program version stringer/frame stiffened shells as well as monocoque structures can be analysed. The dimensions of structural elements will be adapted iteratively to receive a minimum mass solution. An arbitrary number of load cases may be handled. Total calculation times lie in the order of a few seconds (&lt; 10 s) for complex launcher configurations.

The student will perform several tasks:
-Participate in the development of the LSAP software by identifying and solve issues in LSAP and perform test calculations.
-Perform structures analysis for future launchers (possible Ariane, perform trade-off on the materials for different structures)
- CAD Design for launchers parts.
Skills needed:
Background in mechanical engineering (Composite Materials, Structure analysis), Computer Assisted Design (Catia), Programming skills (Fortran)

        <description>Flax threads offer an interesting opportunity for the development of new, improved two-dimensional mesh-structures. Such meshes are used already in different branches of clinical medicine. Two prominent examples are: (i), implantable mesh structures (used to repair incisional hernias in the abdominal wall), and (ii) mesh structures which are used to cover superficial wounds (such as burns, or wounds due to decubitus). The internship will be focussed on the used of flax threads having an antimicrobial surface coating. Such threads will be used to knit experimental meshes, and these will be studied in contact with bacteria in a series of in vitro experiments. Much of the work will be done in collaboration with the Department of Medical Microbiology of the Maastricht University Medical centre. </description>

        <description>The main objective of the MACUMBA project is to develop new methods of microbiological cultures to increase the amount of new microorganisms isolated from different ecosystems. Kevin will characterize and sequence marine strains already isolated from sea samples taken at different depths and at different location around Iceland, and from hydrothermal coastal vents. Furthermore, he will continue to develop new methods to isolate strains at aerobic and anaerobic conditions (with flow cytometry, microwell plates, etc). This work will be done in collaboration with Dr. Pauline Vannier.

The Abalone project focuses on different probiotic effects in aquaculture of abalones . Aquaculture of abalones is well advanced in Iceland and has high economic interest. Matis is developing a new method to avoid infections and mortality of juveniles of Abalones by using probiotic methods instead of antibiotics in collaboration with a farm of Abalones. Kevin will test the effects of probiotics on the growth of Abalones and microbiological susceptibility in abalones. This work will be done in collaboration with Dr. Eyjolfur Reynisson.

        <description>Department
The assignment takes place at the function development shaving systems department of Philips Consumer Lifstyle in Drachten.
Subject
Goal of the assignment is to simulate micro skin behavior in one or more numerical models.
Micro skin behavior is an important effect in shaving system development. The level at which skin protrudes through the openings of a shaving system determines the chance on skin-cutter contact and skin damage.
A better understanding in what mechanisms cause the typical skin behavior in interaction with shaving systems help the development of effective and skin friendly designs. When the skin behavior is captured in numerical simulation models the effect of new designs can be quickly assessed.

Challenge is that skin is a complex material and its (in vivo) properties can only be very indirectly determined.

Activities
1.	Definition of theoretical physical mechanisms describing the micro skin behavior and relevant parameters.
2.	Design of controlled measurements and setup to capture typical skin behavior mechanisms and determine relevant parameters levels.
3.	Execution of skin measurements on volunteers from the department using an advanced measurement system and setup.
4.	Development of a numerical model to simulate the micro skin behavior.
5.	Validation and optimization.

Proposed Scope of Internship for Nikolas Wensjoe

The focus of my laboratory is developing underwater robots which can operate in dynamic shallow 

water environments. My research group takes inspiration from biology to design mechanisms and 

behaviors for underwater vehicles. 

 I am currently engaged in two projects which require creative thinking about prototype manufacturing 

with rigid and flexible materials. The first project is to develop a process to make different wing sections 

which have a rigid leading edge, a flexible trailing edge, and which contain array of embedded pressure 

sensors. The second project is similar, except that in this case we hope to create an entire robot body 

with a mixture of rigid and flexible structures. 

The role of the intern will be to continue the efforts of a previous UTC student, Lucie Dran. Ms. Dran has 

investigated and tested several methods for construction of semi-rigid foils, and has identified a number 

of potentially appropriate sensor components. 

Mr. Wensjoe will be responsible for by designing, implementing, and testing methods for installing 

pressure sensors in the flexible foils developed by Ms. Dran.

The scope of the internship will include:

' Modification of existing mold designs to incorporate sensor and sensor wire placement.

' Development and testing of molding procedure for embedding pressure sensor(s) in wing and 

body sections.

' Analysis of the sensitivity of pressure sensor performance in situ, as a function of manufacturing 

approach.

' Validation of prototype component performance in conjunction with graduate students 

performing in water experiments.</description>

        <description>Inadequate lacrimal gland (LG) secretion results in an aqueous-deficient type of dry eye or Keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS). Patients with KCS can experience intense pain due to eye irritation, gritty/scratchy feeling in the eyes, blurry vision and light sensitivity. If left unmanaged, KCS can have devastating consequences on the ocular surface such as corneal abrasion leading to scarring or ulceration and potentially vision loss. 
Although the mechanisms leading to inadequate lacrimal gland secretion have been extensively investigated, current treatments for KCS consist of application of artificial tears or using punctual plugs to delay tear clearance. However these remedies only offer temporary relief and hence remain largely palliative. Cyclosporine (Restasis) formulated as eye topical eye drops has shown some benefit but only in patients with KCS involving inflammation of the ocular surface. Patients who do not have functioning lacrimal glands (aplasia), have blocked ducts (such as in Stevens-Johnson syndrome), suffer from ocular cicatricial pemphigoid, or experienced a chemical or thermal injury to the ocular surface endure the most severe forms of KCS and would greatly benefit from the fabrication of an implantable tissue-engineered fluid and protein secreting device.
We recently discovered that the LG contains label retaining, slow cycling cells that are involved in repair following experimentally induced injury of the LG. We also discovered that during the repair phase, cells with a mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) phenotype are generated through induction of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We plan to capitalize on these discoveries and use cultured MSCs isolated from injured LGs to engineer a fluid and protein secreting device. The hypotheses being tested are that: 1- MSCs isolated from healing LG tissue can be transformed into polarized, fluid and protein secreting epithelial cells through induction of mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET); and 2-These cells can be used to fabricate a tissue-engineered fluid and protein secreting device using silk-based scaffolds. Silk was selected for the biomaterial system due to its extensive prior use in a range of scaffolds for growing a number of tissues. In addition, silk is an FDA approved biomaterial. To test these hypotheses, we propose the two specific aims: Specific Aim 1: The goal of Aim 1 is to optimize tissue culture conditions necessary to switch MSCs into polarized epithelial cells via induction of MET. Specific Aim 2: The goal of Aim 2 is to use a biomaterials system to fabricate a tissue-engineered fluid and protein secreting device as a first step toward an implantable artificial LG.

        <description>Parkinson is disease (PD) is a major neurodegenerative disease in the elderly affecting 150 000 patients in France. This disease is characterized by massive degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), leading to the clinical diagnosis when already 50% of those neurons are destroyed. Non-invasive imaging biomarkers have the potential to add critical value for earlier diagnosis and therefore for the development of more efficient treatments against the disease. In this regard, animal models play a critical role for the evaluation of biomarkers, disease progression and of the effects of new treatments. The general goal of our project is to evaluate neurodegeneration in the nigro-striatal pathway in a rat model of PD using novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers and histological validation.
The Parkinsonian-like lesions will be induced in rats and their effects in the brain will be assessed using 1) diffusion MRI and tractogrpahy, 2) immunohistochemistry and 3) behavioral tests.
The experimental group will receive a 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) injection and the control (sham) group will be injected with a physiological solution.
1) Longitudinal diffusion MRI will be performed at two time points following the lesioning. Diffusion parameters such as the fractional anisotropy and the mean diffusivity will be quantified and the nigrostriatal pathway will be reconstructed using diffusion-based tractography. The analysis will be based on regions-of-interest (ROI) drawn in the subtantia nigra and in the striatum.
2) Brain sections will be stained with tyrosin hydroxylase. Neural depletion will be quantified using optical density measurements in the same ROIs. The MRI results will be compared to histological quantification.
3) The effect of the lesion will also be assessed with a behavioral study (rotary test) to validate the success of the 6-OHDA lesioning.
We hope to detect structural and functional alterations in the nigrostriatal pathway in PD rats.

        <description>The focus of my laboratory is developing underwater robots which can operate in dynamic shallow water environments.  My research group takes inspiration from biology to design mechanisms and behaviors for underwater vehicles. 

Mr. Fossat will work directly with me to continue the efforts of a previous UTC student intern, Nikolas Wensjoe, to develop a novel compliant gripper mechanism for underwater vehicles.    This project will require creative thinking about prototype manufacturing with rigid and flexible materials.   It will also required hands-on work to construct, test, and analyze the performance of the manipulator in underwater applications.  There will potentially be opportunities to participate in field tests at sea.  

The scope of the internship will include:
?	Mechanical design for modification and refinement of existing gripper mechanism parts
?	Development and implementation of an experimental program to measure the holding strength of the gripper as a function of material selection and target object geometry.
?	Integration of the gripper mechanism with an underwater hydraulic arm sled for use in tank test and at-sea field trials.
?	Validation of prototype component performance in conjunction with graduate students performing in-water experiments.

Mr. Fossat will also be expected to participate fully in the operation of the research lab, including attending and presenting results at an internal seminar, and assisting Dr. Licht and other undergraduate and graduate students in the lab with related experiments.

The production has started about 1.5 year ago but the production line is not where it has to be to perform properly. As a result, there is methods work to be completed. The target for this year is to reduce the hours spent per tram by a third.
The main core activities that will be part of the student's scope of work:
- Review all Gantt charts and work plans - update 
- mBOM validation (reviewing discrepancies between actual usage and mBOM, find root cause and update mBOM with planning) 
- Define (or refine) action list coming from time study (currently under process) and implement 
- Support line back exercise </description>

        <description>Thales Singapore is producing several power supply boards used into aeronautics equipment.

The production process is to perform testing on each power supply with  a dedicated tester in a thermal chamber at several temperature ( cold, ambient and hot temperature) as the testing time is short, several unit are loaded at the same time in the thermal chamber, and the operators need to open the thermal chamber to exchange the unit under test. This operation is time consuming and generate wasted time on our production.

 

The aim of this project is to identify and design a technical solution to automatize the power supply loading in the test fixture without  human operation. The designed solution must take into account the extreme temperature inside the thermal chamber and the high cost of the unit under test ( high reliability expected).

 

The intern will have to handle the complete study, from needs definition to solution design and to take into account all the constraints induced by aircraft part?s production.</description>

The trainee will participate in different level of Amadeus products:
    * The UI enhancement of the website application, to add the menu selection and upsell;
    * The Booking engine (frontend), to manage the business rule for the proposed menu such as catalog according to the route, inventory check, prices;
    * The connection with Amadeus Central System, to store the content of the menu;
    * The administration of the catalog and the inventory;
    * Collecting feedbacks via voting;
    * The reporting for airline stock management and statistics.
 
The analysis will include a research for the most appropriated technical solution: usability for the upsell; how and where to store the information about the menu; connectivity to inform the airline.
 
A significant part of the internship will be to participate in the conception and implementation of a prototype in order to make a demonstration to Product Managers and participate to a contest.
This solution could later be extended to other Amadeus products: Trip management on mobiles, Call Centers, etc.
Internship could be shared with other trainees, including people from the commercial and marketing organization.

        <description>OBJECTIVES

This study will be part of the LAB 2016 project. Its aim is focused on the investigation of the possibilities offered by UV-Visible spectrophotometry to quantify the amounts of various APIs   in buffer solutions close in terms of composition to interstitium fluids that can be found in sub-cutaneous media. 
The first objective of this study will be centered on the characterization of the overall performances of such instruments in the context of MedinCell procedures. Quantities such as the Lowest Limit of Quantification (LLOQ), the highest Limit of Quantification (HLOQ) and the response linearity range will be identified for a selection of well-chosen APIs dissolved in various solution media with increasing complexity. In parallel, the influence of the design of the spectrophotometric cells will be explored, as it matters that the volumes of fluids are kept as low as possible. 

The second objective of the study is to develop a comprehensive protocol for an optimal use of UV-Vis instruments, in order to extract the exact amount of any API in a given solution media. The protocol should include the preparation of standard mixtures and blank solutions, a step of calibration, a step of signal processing to deconvolve the contribution of the APIs and finally a QAQC (Quality Assurance and Quality Control) procedure.  

DEVELOPMENT AND TIMELINES 

- 	Bibliography

Bibliography should be centered on the UV instruments and spectrophotometric technics to properly calibrate these instruments and overcome matrix interferences.

A period of one month is planned for this part of the study. 

- 	Introduction to UV-Vis instruments and good laboratory practices

A period of two weeks is planned to get used to good laboratory practices and the instruments installed in the laboratory. 

- 	Experiments and computations 

Various APIs and buffer solutions, in different but known amounts, will be prepared and directly analyzed using at least one UV-Vis spectrophotometer, equipped with cells of different volumes and geometries. Systematic analysis of a blank solution (buffer solution without any adding of API) will be also carried out for each experiment, for comparison and further processing. Replicate samples will be analyzed at the beginning and at the end of each batch of experiments to quantify the accuracy and the possible drifts of the method.
In parallel, acquired spectra will be explored and mathematically processed according to the different methods described in the literature and possibly according to home made numerical processing recipes, with the aim to extract with the lowest possible uncertainty the concentration of the API.         
At the end of the training period, a protocol will be developed, comprising all the necessary steps to quantify the amount of any API in a given buffer solution. With the mathematical method selected to compute the API concentration in the buffer solution, it will be blind tested to demonstrate the capabilities of the overall method.
This step is planned over a period of 18 weeks. 

- 	Reporting 
Some time will be freeing up to write the report of the study. To avoid any stress and last moment issues, it is strongly recommended to write continuously this report from the first day to the last day.

        <description>OBJECTIVES

This study will be part of the LAB 2016 project. It will be focused on the characterization of the API release in microfluidic flowing conditions. 

Various mechanisms on the surface and in the volume of the depots are involved in the overall API release, so it is likely that a scaling down of the quantities of materials involved in the release tests will have a direct impact on the observed kinetics.

The study will first be dedicated to the development of a method to accurately control the size and the shape of the depots. 

Such a method will then be used to form various depots that will be characterized in release tests to understand the effect of the scaling. 

Depending on the progress of the study, additional characterizations could also be carried out. Effects of flow rates and/or agitation, for instance, could be studied to get a better idea on the contribution of diffusion and convection on the overall release.

DEVELOPMENT AND TIMELINES 

- 	Bibliography

A survey of the literature dealing with API releasing from polymer matrixes will be carried out to identify the various mechanisms that are involved and that should be taken into account for a scaling down of the depots.

A period of one month is planned for this part of the study. 

- 	Experiments on the formation of the depots

Various technics will be developed and tested to control the depots formation. In parallel, a method to precisely characterize the size and the shape of those depots will be developed. Different formulations will be used to check the generality of the method. 

Two months will be dedicated to this part of the study.

- 	Characterization of the releasing properties of the depots

Depots with various sizes and shapes will be tested in a prototype assembly comprising reactors of different sizes, pumps able to control the flows through the reactors and an online analytical device to monitor the amounts of API released through time.      

The analysis of the results will be carried out to propose a model allowing for scaling down the materials needed for each experiment.  

This step is planned over a period of thee months. 

- 	Reporting 

Some time will be freeing up to write the report of the study. To avoid any stress and last moment issues, it is strongly recommended to write the report on a daily basis.

        <description>The manufacturing of glasswool is a complex process that makes use of raw materials (sand, recycled glass) to make ready to use insulation panels.
One part of the process concerns the polymerization of the binder which gives mechanical cohesion to the product. This step is performed in a dedicated equipment: the curing oven. 

The curing process of our products is complex; its understanding requires the knowledge of several physical mechanisms, such as the heat transfer coefficient in porous media. Thanks to an experimental oven, which replicates the curing step in the production lines, full scale measurements can be performed. They provide a characterization of the curing with respect to the product's parameters, such as density, thickness, and fiber type.

The mission of this internship is to make use of the full scale industrial oven, to enhance the thermal model describing the curing process. It includes an experimental, a numerical, and a modeling approach of the problem. The internship will be performed in a pluri-disciplinary environment, and it will be run in collaboration with another Saint-Gobain research centers (SGR in Aubervilliers). The tools developed during the internship will be implemented in several plants of Saint-Gobain insulation activity in the world.

        <description>Osteoarthritis (OA) is the primary disease causing functional disability in Western medicine, the cartilage breakdown can be initiated by the mechanical environment, such as overloading or trauma. To author¿s knowledge and up to date, the link between loadings, subchondral bone mechanical properties and pathological process in OA remains an open question. At the microscale the biomechanical properties of the subchondral bone femur in mouse change with OA and we hypothesize that the subchondral bone can be considered as a biomarker of OA progression. Coworkers have developed an in vivo loading model in the murine knee (Poulet et al. 2011), in which prescribed loads are applied to the flexed distal hindlimb through loading cups on the knee and ankle as follow : 
 
Murine knee loading : In vivo loading model
The goal of this study is to obtain, from Raman spectrum of subchondral bone, informations on bone mineral crystallinity that is related to bone hardness but also to provide information on the orientation of mineral crystallites with respect to the collagen fibril axis. The candidate will performe loading experiment on mice and then characterize the subchondral bone using Raman spectroscopy.

        <description>Background: In healthy individuals, somatosensory feedback from the fingertips is integrated with motor commands to ensure successful object manipulation (Zhang et al., 2010). Fundamental aspects of sensorimotor integration can be studied by 1) investigating the principles underlying the mapping between motor commands and reduced or absent sensation feedback in patients with neuromuscular diseases such as carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) (Zhang et al., 2011,2012,2013) or in healthy individuals with anesthetic injection, and 2) quantifing the multi-digit coordination during human-machine interactions in a complex mechanical environments created by a haptic-robotic system.

Objectives: The current study will be pursued through a series of experiments involving participants from healthy subjects to patients with sensorimotor deficits. The objectives of this study is 1) to quantify the role of sensory feedback (i.e., vision, proprioception and tactile inputs) on motor planning and learning; (2) to study the effects of neurological disorders on the CNS¿s ability to use synergies for controlling complex movements; and (3) to quantify and compare the effects of therapeutic treatments on the recovery of hand function following peripheral neuropathy (e.g., CTS).

        <description>Team Description:
Amadeus is a world leader in providing IT solutions for the whole travel industry. It provides a comprehensive set of products for managing airline business from reservation to operational systems managing passengers and aircrafts at the airport. 
Within this set of applications, our team is in charge of managing travel payments. This ranges from processing many methods of payments with many devices (and much more than credit card on web) to performing security checks, fraud checks, reconciliation, analytics, virtual credit cards, dynamic currency conversions and anything that could reduce payment costs for our customer but as well enable them to gain marketshare.
In term of organization, the team is at the heart of the central operational reservation system (the largest company data center in Europe!) and is a very critical application connected to many payment partners processing a huge number of transactions.
Technically, we are developing large scale server side applications, in fully distributed environment (SOA, clustering...), using state of the art technologies (Linux, Oracle, ?in memory'' databases, Application engine...).
The team activities are fully integrated, including both developers and product analysts. We are also closely working with the data center teams and the marketing. This is a perfect opportunity to learn about different specialties in IT industry.

Main Responsibilities:
Amadeus Payment Platform is connected to dozens of payment service provider and supports hundreds of methods of payment. We are integrated in many channels (web, face2face, kiosk etc...).
It represents then a huge amount of use cases, different behaviours, protocols to support then to validate.
More, not all payment services provider provide a stable and production alike testing platform.

All in one, we have to simulate many of the third parties in test systems to mimic production behaviour and validate properly. That's why we have today a suite of simulator tools.

However we need now to go to the next level from tools to an advanced payment simulator application. This is the goal of this internship.

The intern will have the opportunity to play with hype technologies: python, HTML 5, google angularjs, NOSQL mongodb, REST JSON APis etc...

The intern will have also the opportunity to meet a lot of Amadeus people to interview them and build the best product adapted to their needs.


This internship will cover all aspects of the development activities from the scope analysis to the implementation of a technical solution

        <description>In 2014 we carried out a series of successful Dispelair antifoam trials at eight Tereos sugar factories. The trials were in three different areas of the sugar production process; beet washing, diffusion and ethanol fermentation. In the forthcoming sugar campaign (September 2015 to January 2016) we hope to secure continued supply of our antifoams to several of the factories. This will require Technical support to ensure efficient use of our products. In addition, we will introduce new antifoams for further trials in order to improve cost efficiency. We also wish to carry out antifoam trials in other application areas of those factories. 
In addition to working with Tereos we wish to extend our contacts to other companies in France, both in the sugar and other industries.
The role
- learn about the relevant processes. 
- Understand the significance of an effective Foam Control Agent in the processes.

This will be achieved by training at Blackburn Chemicals Ltd prior to the campaign plus visits with Blackburn Chemicals Ltd personnel to Tereos factories and possibly UK sugar factories.
-take a significant role in the monitoring and optimisation of Dispelair antifoams at the Tereos factories.
-	Submit reports on performance of the antifoams and discuss optimisation with key personnel.
-	Take a significant role in the monitoring and optimisation of further Dispelair antifoam trials in new areas of the factories.
-    Assist with introduction of Blackburn Chemicals Ltd to other processing companies in France.

The intern will work closely with Blackburn Chemicals Ltd personnel, but the programme is likely to be dynamic so flexibility and independent working will be required as experience is gained.

-On completion of the sugar campaign in France the intern will assist in other projects within the area of foam control.

This will take place in January and February 2016 and will involve working with Blackburn Chemicals Ltd personnel in UK (or other European countries) to carry out industrial visits / trials, possibly in other industrial processes. It is not possible at this stage to determine in which industries this work will take place, but it could be in potato / starch processing, paper manufacture or sugar / ethanol manufacture.

        <description>Big Edge ambition is to transform the firm transactions/market/flow data
and research into a valuable and intelligent entity that can drive
profitable activity. Big edge is an innovative product founded on leading
edge big data technology and ground breaking machine learning algorithms to
convey an intelligent, fast and trend setting offer to both internal and
external users (Inside Edge, Outside Edge).  Big Edge combines anonymized
aggregated structured market/flow data with unstructured relevant
information (from both internal and external data sources) such as research
documents, trade ideas, news, videos, web content, social media content
(Ideas Warehouse); the smart enterprise search and relevance engine which
sits on top of the data lake automatically understands the topics of the
contents and suggests strategic relevant market content based on user's
search, web activity, trading activity and similar users' patterns. The
front end applications will not only offer highly interactive data
visualization, but also advanced and innovative data driven capabilities
such as smart search, sentiment analysis and products/content suggestion.
Big Edge encloses an intrinsic social ecosystem of analytics and research
which, combined with user interaction and automatic client profiling will
be an extraordinary enhancement to our cross selling capabilities.
Big Edge is composed of three main components:

     information  of  Newedge/SG  market  presence  as a cross selling and
     promotional tool. It represents one convenient place to view publicly
     available information about our trading volumes and market shares and
     to promote our strengths to existing and potential clients to improve
     our global cross selling capabilities.
     Outside  edge  highlights  how can we leverage our significant global
     presence  to  bring  added  value  to  our management and sales force
     offering   by   illustrating  our  cross  market  competitiveness  to
     potential and existing clients.
In  an era where events and propagation of effects happen everywhere and at
an  always growing pace, being able to combine our market intelligence with
the ability of capturing emerging trends before they manifest themselves in
the  market  will  position  SG in a strategic, innovative and leading edge

        <description>We work with the albino (tyrosinase negative) mouse.  
Now we want to know whether L-Dopa treatment will restore the neurons in ventrotemporal retina that give rise to the ipsilateral visual pathway in pigmented animals.  We know that L-Dopa treatment results in neurogenesis in the retina of the albinos. The project would be part of this endeavor.  The work would involve extraction of catechol substances from retina, as well has histological procedures to study the retina and the effects of L-Dopa treatment.  
The project would involve handling mice, there would be dissections and also histology.
The questions we would like to answer for the project are:
Does administration of L-Dopa to albino fetuses increase the numbers of Zic2 positive neurons in ventral retina.  These are not present in untreated albinos.  These are present in pigmented retina and they are the origins of the ipsilateral projections of the optic nerve.  The ipsilateral projects are severely reduced in the albino, a condition that causes problems with vision.  If we find that the Zic2 cells are restored in the albino fetal retina with L-Dopa treament the next step will be to discover whether or not the ipsilateral pathway is restored.  In each case the condition will be compared to that in normal pigmented mice.</description>

Keywords: Medical Image Processing / Magnetic Resonance Imaging

The training period will be done in the METRIQ team in LTSI-INSERM U1099 (http://www.ltsi.univ-rennes1.fr/), in collaboration with Prof. Yan Rolland of the Comprehensive Cancer Center, Institute Eugène Marquis, Department of Nuclear Medicine, Rennes, France. 

Medical context: 
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers in the world. It is responsible for more than half a million deaths each year. Treatment like resection, external beam radiation, chemotherapy, radiofrequency present some limitations. Selective intra-arterial radioembolization therapy (SIRT) with microspheres radiolabeled with Yttrium-90 (90Y) is an emerging technique for the treatment of patients with unresectable tumors. This therapy has promising clinical outcomes and small side effects. It is a minimally invasive catheter-based therapy that delivers internal radiation via the arterial vessels that feed the tumor. Presence of a shunt between the hepatic arterial vascularization and the lungs is one of the main criteria of exclusion for radio-embolization.
Objective: 
Precise shunt estimation is then a crucial task to be achieved before applying the therapy. The currently used imaging modality SPECT is not the most efficient way to detect extrahepatic shunting. Our goal is here to propose a non-invasive MRI/CT based method of pulmonary shunt estimation, which could avoid the angiography examination currently realized for all patients (invasive and costly modality). 

The objective of this training period is composed of 2 main steps: 
1. Collection and analysis of existing images: 
-	Data collection: collaboration with Dr Yan Rolland radiologist and Head of the medical imaging department at the Center Eugène Marquis from Rennes to select images from patients having a pulmonary shunt. 
-	Qualitative image analysis: extraction from these images of visual abnormalities showing the presence of a shunt.
-	Quantitative image analysis: development and implementation of image analysis methods to detect and characterize the shunt.

2. Optimization of the current protocol: 

The current MRI protocol already includes dynamic acquisition at the 4 typical times useful to characterize the tumor after injection of contrast product (arterial, portal and two late times). This protocol could be improved by:
- Introduction of coronal slice acquisition (in addition to the current transversal ones)
- Increase of the temporal resolution

        <description>Theme: Functionality of concentrated casein dispersions
 
Description:
 
Currently we work on the physical-chemical functionality and behaviour of concentrated casein dispersions. What are the mechanisms involved, how can we steer them and especially how can we apply this knowledge into new products or better processes? Items of importance are protein structure, salt- and protein equilibria, viscosity, water holding, etc. The project team consists of dairy and structuring scientists, product experts and technicians. 


Theme: Functionality of milk lipids
 
Description
Milk is a rich source of nutritional ingredients. Centrifugation of milk results in a concentrated cream containing a high concentration of milk fat globules. The milk fat globules contain both milk fat and milk phospholipids. These components are separated and processed further into milk fat fractions with strongly differing melting characteristics and concentrated phospholipid streams. FrieslandCampina has a large interest in these ingredients especially from a physico-chemical point of view . The thesis subject aims to study functionality of milk lipids (both fat and phospholipid). Possible subjects are:

Effect of milk derived phospholipids on crystallization of milk fat
Separation and concentration of milk phospholipids
Structural functionality of phospholipids in different products

        <description>DMT Environmental Technology is a company who is specialized in gas and water cleaning. The main products of the company are the Carborex MS, Sulfurex CS, Sulfurex BF and Sulfurex BR. The Carborex MS is a membrane system which can upgrade biogas to biomethane used as replacement for natural gas in national gas grids, or as a transport fuel as CNG or LNG. The Sulfurex CS is a chemical scrubber where H2S can be removed from air or gas streams, whereas the Sulfurex BF is a biological scrubber to remove H2S. The Sulfurex BR is a combinated system where a chemical scrubber reacts with the H2S and in a biological reactor the caustic is mostly recovered.

DMT is an international company who wants to expand their horizon and introduce these products into new markets. One of the focus areas of DMT is South East Asia, where there is huge potential for biogas production because of the amount of organic waste in the palm oil industry. 

For this internship we are looking for a student who can work together with the R&amp;D and Engineering department to adjust and improve the current products and make them suitable for the South Asian Market.

        <description>The Mobility, Vehicles, and Electricity System Research Lab (Moves-Lab) conducts R&amp;D to support the development and adoption of cleaner and more efficient vehicles, and enable the integration of these vehicles with larger infrastructure systems. Our research bridges from understanding fundamental phenomena at the powertrain sub-component level, to applying these fundamental phenomena to understand and mitigate impacts at large scales of millions of vehicles. We develop and apply simulation tools, validated by experimental measurements, to examine R&amp;D challenges from the scale of single vehicles or powertrain components, to the integration of many vehicles with infrastructure systems such as the electricity grid.
More important than simply being a collection of research areas, Moves-Lab is a collection of talented, curious, and driven people. Moves-Lab fosters learning and growth for all our team members, provides a forum for exchange of ideas, and provides a foundation for our team to make an impact on society through R&amp;D at the interfaces between mobility, vehicles, and the electricity system. While we all work to enable success in our respective project areas, we keep an open mind to new ideas and new possibilities.

        <description>Abstract 
High throughput in biological assays has become a focus of today's research. Cell culture is a method used for growing living cells artificially outside their natural environment under controlled conditions. It is used for a large range of applications such as studies of cellular functions, drug discovery, biotechnologies and regenerative medicine. Cell culture in vitro is generally performed on plastic substrates, especially multi-well plates or Petri dishes that are made of polystyrene, a very stiff and synthetic material. However, this stiff substrate can bias the experimental results and mask cellular responses. Indeed, these culture conditions contrast drastically with the cellular microenvironment in vivo, where the cells are surrounded by a soft extra-cellular matrix (ECM) that provides mechanical and biochemical signals. Our aim in the BioaActiveCoatings project, which is supported by the European Commission (European Research Council, Proof of Concept) is to engineer thin films made of biopolymers as coating of multiple well plates for cell culture. 
We will bring to the market these innovative surface-coated plates with a control over thickness, stiffness and presentation of bioactive molecules (peptide, growth factors) for guiding the fate of stem cells. 

Detailed internship proposal  
Layer-by-layer films are a new type of self-assembled materials, which are more and more widely used by research groups in view of their potential applications (1) and which begin to be used by industrial companies. Our team has an internationally recognized expertise in the engineering of layer-by-layer films made of biopolymers (2, 3). 
The innovative strategy of the BioaActiveCoatings project consists in using the layer-by-layer assembly of biopolymers in multi-well plates, which are compatible with biological assays and optical microscopy. The LbL-coated multi-well plates will broaden the application of cell culture plates in research and industry for fundamental biological studies, production of biological molecules, diagnosis and regenerative medicine.
The aims of the internship are: 1) to create a custom-made platform by fully exploiting the potentialities of an automated liquid handling machine to build the layer-by-layer films; 2) to characterize the as-prepared films by several physical-chemical techniques (confocal microscopy, infrared spectroscopy, profilometry and AFM) to assess their reproducibility, homogeneity and 3) to assess their bioactivity by means of biological assays on stem cells.
Location
The candidate will be working at the LMGP lab in the IMBM team in collaboration with a company developing automated liquid handling machines. For more information about the lab and team : http://www.lmgp.grenoble-inp.EN/

Profile &amp; requested skills
5th year engineering school with an interest for biomedical engineering, biotechnologies, in vitro diagnosis and tissue engineering. This internship is at the interface between engineering and life sciences. Aptitude for teamwork, good spoken and written English are requested.

        <description>The student will complete the building and testing of an anaerobic digestion test machine. The machine will be modified with pressure transducers, thermocouples, and carbon dioxide measuring devices as needed. Sample biodegradable materials, e.g., food waste, paper, PHA biodegradable plastic will be placed in the test machine and the carbon dioxide will be measured. The concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane will be measured with  a gas chromatograph test machine. Other plastic materials, e.g., PHA, PLA, PCL, and LDPE will be measured for biodegradation after 30 and 60 days. Once a steady stream of methane is produced a heater that is powered by methane will be modified to burn the methane from the digester.

        <description>Description of the subject: DMV (www.dmv.nl), part of FrieslandCampina’s business group Ingredients, is a well-known producer of different types of milk protein preparations, such caseinates, whey protein concentrates and specialty type of products such as lactoferrin. DMVs milk protein preparations are widely recognized as highly functional food ingredients for a wide variety of food products. They combine an excellent techno-functionality (solubility, emulsifying, texturizing) with a high nutritional value.
One of their applications is protein-enriched yoghurts. This internship will focus on achieving understanding of the role of different milk protein ingredients and their combinations in this application. Therefore, fermentation and protein technology will be combined with physical-chemical characterization, e.g. rheological behaviour. Final aim is to, based on better understanding,  tune protein ingredient properties and/or develop new products or better processes. 

The team: The DMV development team is located in the new Innovation Centre of FrieslandCampina in Wageningen, The Netherlands, on the campus of the Wageningen University. Within the Development Team of DMV there is a long history in supervising both bachelor and master students from different countries.  The team intensively collaborates with other research/expert teams within the Innovation Centre.

        <description>The internship would be within one of our major remediation projects for a multinational petrochemical corporation, which employs an international team of Aecom engineers and scientists. The current phase of the remedial programm includes recovery of free phase hydrocarbons (or NAPL - Non Aqueous Phase Liquids) from the groundwater via 170 recovery wells across an area of 25 hectares and Vapour Intrusion mitigation measures in adjacent residential buildings.
 
It is intended that the internship is focused on the science and technology associated with effective recovery of NAPL from the groundwater.  This complex matter is governed by a multitude of hydrogeological as well as remediation technology aspects, for which science and technology has been gradually emerging over the past decade.  Together with our client, Aecom is seeking to better understand the extent to which NAPL is recoverable in order to forecast the duration and end-point of this phase of the remedial programme.  In close collaboration with the project manager and project engineers, the scope of the internship would hence be to:
-  Review and compile existing and emerging technical and scientific literature on the subject of NAPL mobility in the subsurface and its recoverability.
-  Utilise data from the remediation project to contribute to optimisation of the technical approach for effective NAPL recovery and, to the extent possible, to forecast the likely duration of NAPL recovery in different areas and establish a method for systematically achieving close-out of the remediation programm.

        <description>Epilepsy is one of the most neurological disorders that affects 0.5 - 0.8 % of the population. It is responsible of brief paroxysmal epochs, well known as seizures. These latter are caused by the abnormal hypersynchronous of one or several cerebral regions. In less than one third of the cases, epileptic seizures persist even with drug-based treatment. This is why they are called drug-resistant epilepsies. These seizures merge originally in a limited cerebral region, called Epileptogenic Zone (EZ). Therefore, a surgical solution consisting of resecting these EZ is proposed such that the epileptic seizure could be stopped with minimum of surgery side-effects. 
Several factors could result in a precise EZ resection: a robust presurgical protocol with different feedbacks involved. These latter are more or less the results of non-invasive clinical, anatomic and functional explorations. Using available observations, the goal is to identify the EZ responsible of the generation of the epileptic seizure. The organization of the EZ is assimilated to a neural network of populations relatively distributed over distant structures and responsible of the onset and the propagation of the epileptic seizure. This distributed structure complicates in some way the localisation and the characterization of the neural networks. It is noteworthy that a precise EZ resection could be contemplated using intracerebral ElectroEncephaloGraphic (iEEG) data acquired through intracranial electrodes. Indeed, although the latter iEEG data are invasive, it permits to a tiny exploration of the cerebral cortex.

The identification of the (uni/bi-directional) interactions between the different cerebral areas incorporated in the neural networks is a major issue during the presurgical phase and stands for the major objective of this project. It is enrolled particularly in the context of effective connectivity using advanced signal processing techniques towards to oriented graphs of connectivity representation. These graphs shed light upon the direct and indirect, unilateral or bilateral causal links through propagation pathways that could exist between the graph nodes. These nodes denote the cerebral regions from macroscopic point of view.

In order to infer effective connectivity, several approaches have been proposed in the literature. However all of them highlight the limits of the so-called linear methods compared to the potential of the non-linear non-parametric ones. These latter are information theory-based functions, such as transfer entropy. On the other hand, several effective causality measures have been proposed. Among them, the Granger causality in both time and frequency variants and the transfer entropy. In addition to these approaches, recent model-based methods have also been proposed using the relevant dynamic causal modelling concept.
In this internship, in a first step, different information-based approaches will be considered by evaluating their performance using realistic simulated iEEG thanks to the macroscopic computational model developed in our team. In a second step, real iEEG acquired from epileptic patients in the department of Neurology in the CHU of Rennes will be also used. Thirdly, ongoing model-based techniques will be considered and evaluated and compared to the information-based techniques.

This internship will take place in the LTSI laboratory (Laboratoire Traitement du Signal et de l'Image, Université de Rennes 1). It will permit to (i) identify both the pros. and the cons. of the considered connectivity methods in the context of drug-resistant epilepsy, (ii) retain the most adequate method by combining the obtained results with those of the clinical experts in order to improve later.

        <description>Norway and Iceland are among the world's leading seafood nations and this has been achieved by increased value adding and knowledge-based management of resources. France is an important producer but also the major European fish importing country. The main challenge remains though in successfully maintaining freshness, quality and value as well as safety of seafood through handling, processing and distribution.
Seafood deterioration is mostly governed by microbial and biochemical activities which are influenced by temperature and storage conditions. The main cause of bacterial contamination of fish processing line is due to rapid bacterial proliferation on the skin during early storage which spreads during filleting and by post-contamination during processing. Reducing the microbiota before process and preventing its development during storage will extend shelf life.
The main objective of the SAFEFISHDISH project is to improve the microbial and sensory quality and safety of fish from harvest to consumer. The project will focus on farmed salmon and wild cod, which are the major species traded in Europe. Novel handling techniques and combination of innovative preservation technologies involving biopreservatives (protective cultures and chitosan), superchilling and modified atmosphere will be evaluated. Treatment well ahead of the food chain (on the skin upon harvest and on flesh just after filleting) may maximize its efficiency and will be explored. Combination of these preservation techniques is innovative and needs to be tested. Bacterial ecosystem and their metabolism profile will be explored via modern tools such as new generation sequencing (NGS) and various chromatographic methods. Developed innovative handling and processing technologies will better control safety and deterioration of valuable seafood and, simultaneously, contribute to nutritional quality and consumer health as well as increased sales return and competitiveness of European seafood. So for this project at the Matis lab we are doing microbial counting for variable samples, qPCR for spoilage bacteria, DNA extraction method developments for different samples, NGS and  sensory analysis.

        <description>Osteoarthritis (OA)  is the primary disease causing functional disability in Western medecine, the cartilage breakdown can be initiated by the mechanical environment such as overloading or trauma.
To author's knowledge and up to date, the link between loadings, subchondral bone mechanical properties and pathological process in OA remains an open question. At the microscale the biomechanical properties of the subchondral bone femur in mouse change with OA  and we hypothesize that the subchondral bone can be considered as a marker of OA progression. Coworkers have developed an in vivo loading model in them urine knee in which prescribed loads are applied to the flexed distal hindlimb through loading cups on the knee and ankle.

THE GOAL  of this study is to obtain informations on bone mineral crystallinity from Raman spectrum of subchondral bone that is related to bone hardness obtained from Atomic Force Macroscopy. The candidate will perform loading experimetn on mice and then characterize the subchondral bone using Raman Spectroscopy and Atomic force microscopy.</description>

        <description>Outline of the stage

Context 
Freeze-drying is a drying process in which the solvent is removed, in two consecutive steps, by means of sublimation and desorption. Because of the use of low operative temperatures, this process is particularly suitable for products that could be damaged by high temperatures, such as pharmaceuticals and biologicals. However, the global efficiency of the process is limited by the heterogeneity of the final product quality within the batch. The understanding of the mechanisms causing product heterogeneity and their measurements (qualitative and quantitative) can help in optimize the freeze-drying process.
In this context, this stage will focus on the evaluation of the product heterogeneity during the secondary drying step, in which diffusion and desorption phenomena takes places in the dried matrix of the product.

Main objectives:
- 	Short literature review;
- 	To run freeze-drying cycles, in collaboration/under the supervision of Bernadette Scutellà (PhD student), focusing in particular on the secondary drying step;
- 	Analyse the final product using the Karl-Fischer titration and other relevant methods.

        <description> During the previous 2 sugar campaigns we carried out a series of successful Dispelair antifoam trials at Tereos sugar factories. The trials were in three different areas of the sugar production process; beet washing, diffusion and ethanol fermentation. In the 2015-16 sugar campaign we secured continued supply of our antifoams to several of the factories. This required Technical support to ensure efficient use of our products. We hope to gain further business in the group for the forthcoming campaign, which will require continued support. In addition, we will introduce new antifoams for further trials in order to improve cost efficiency. We also wish to carry out antifoam trials in other application areas of those factories. 
In addition to working with Tereos we wish to extend our contacts to other companies in France and other countries, both in sugar and other industries.
The role
•	Learn about the relevant processes. 
•	Understand the significance of an effective Foam Control Agent in the processes.
This will be achieved by training at Blackburn Chemicals Ltd prior to the campaign plus visits with Blackburn Chemicals Ltd personnel to Tereos factories and UK sugar factories and other industrial customers.
•	Take a significant role in the monitoring and optimisation of Dispelair antifoams at the Tereos factories.
•	Submit reports on performance of the antifoams and discuss optimisation with key personnel.
•	Take a significant role in the monitoring and optimisation of Dispelair antifoams in other factories and industries, probably potato / starch processing and paper manufacturing.
•	Assist with introduction of Blackburn Chemicals Ltd to other processing companies in France and other regions.

The intern will work closely with Blackburn Chemicals Ltd personnel, but the programme is likely to be dynamic so flexibility and independent working will be required as experience is gained.

•	During the sugar campaign in France and certainly after the campaign the intern will assist in other projects within the area of foam control.

This will take place in January and February 2017 and will involve working with Blackburn Chemicals Ltd personnel in UK (or other European countries) to carry out industrial visits / trials, possibly in other industrial processes. It is not possible at this stage to determine in which industries this work will take place, but it could be in potato / starch processing, paper manufacture or sugar / ethanol manufacture.

        <description>Understanding how cells interact with their environment if of great importance for the development of tissue engineered therapies. When cells attach to a substrate, they generate traction forces by anchoring to the solid material and contracting. How the material responds to this provides important clues for cellular decision making, driving processes like cell migration, division or differentiation into mature cell types.
Cell traction force microscopy is a powerful technique for measuring the forces generated by cells on soft materials, and will play a crucial roble in developing biomaterials for repair of damaged body issues. The methode involves image analysis to determine the amount of substrate deformation when cells attach to a substrate , followed by the reconstruction of the force exerted by the cell from a mechanical analysis.

This project will develop and test a technique for CTFM . The first stage will involve developing materials and culturing cells for image analysis. Next, a computational tool will be developed to map the experimentally measured substrate deformation to the cell traction. The project will bring new insight into cell-substrate interactions.</description>

        <description>Low back pain is a widespread disorder, with tremendous socio-economic impact. While this condition is multi-factorial, intervertebral disc degeneration is one of its main causes. Actual treatments are mostly symptomatic (aiming to alleviate pain) and new therapies are needed. Disc degeneration is characterized by the inability of the resident cells to keep the disc tissue intact due to a change of their phenotype and their decreasing number. Thus, delivery of exogenous cells may help, such as adult bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). These cells have been used, however with limited success, i.e. disc degeneration was only inhibited and not reversed. We believe that this failure is, in part, due to the inability of the transplanted cells to produce enough/appropriate disc matrix. One reason for the sub-optimal results of BMSC transplantation can be their poor ability to survive and/or function in the disc environment, a unique environment low in oxygen, pH, glucose and high in osmotic pressure. Based on our previous work on BMSCs and bone tissue engineering, we think that the shortage in glucose, aggravated when exogenous cells are added in the environment, is the main cause to this poor cell survival and functionality.
The student will participate to a starting project aiming to provide the disc with an exogenous source of glucose to compensate the higher consumption due to cell injection and avoid glucose shortage. To do so, injectable hydrogels that will slowly release glucose by degradation of their macromolecular structure will be used. Such type of hydrogel has already been developed by the B2OA for bone tissue engineering.
The student will assess the ability of this gel to help BMSC survive and function in cell culture conditions mimicking the disc environment. In the scope of this project, the student will work with cell culture, biochemical assays, flow cytometry, and PCR.</description>

        <description>Despite the wealth of knowledge we have acquired since the development of DNA sequencing, we are still unable to predict phenotype from genotype and this remains one of the great unanswered questions.  While genetic techniques have allowed us to identify genes that are implicated in many phenotypes, often the mere presence or absence of these genes is not sufficient to predict phenotype.  We still need a method for quantifying the contribution of individual genes to a given phenotype.  Gene expression is controlled by a combination of direct regulation of genes by a regulatory network of transcription factors, as well as indirectly by changes to the cellular state, for example in the case of prokaryotes the nucleoid structure and ribosomal activity.  The Laboratoire de Biochimie (LBC) at ESPCI Paris-Tech specializes in droplet based microfluidics for very high throughput screening.  We combine this technology with genetic mutant libraries to exam how master genetic regulators control gene expression in E. coli, to determine how genetically identical cells can present phenotypically distinct sub-populations.  As such we are looking for a highly motivated student for a 6 month internship to help us in construction and screening of E. coli mutants.  You will have the opportunity to use new molecular tools such as CRISPR-Cas9 to generate high- throughput mutants as well as cutting edge screening techniques such as droplet based single cell RNA sequencing (Drop-Seq).  Additionally, the research you will be contributing to has direct applications to the treatment of drug tolerant sub populations of human pathogens, as well as to fundamental research into control of genetic networks.</description>

        <description>The Search, Shopping &amp; Pricing (SSP) product engineering group serves the core Distribution business of Amadeus as well as Airline IT e-commerce business and the Rail IT and Travel Intelligence new businesses. It is responsible in particular for the travel Search and Shopping products, which power today a vast number of airline and travel agent websites.
In the Product Solution &amp; Quality department, the Airline Search and Shopping department is responsible for designing the right solutions for our Search and Shopping products for Airlines and delivering them with the best quality.

Main responsibilities
 
Part of the team activity is to provide high quality support to our customers, the airlines. In this scope we need to help airlines understand how they use our products and more important how they could improve this usage to maximise the revenue they get from ticket sales on their own website.
To improve our performance in this domain we would like to leverage the data we gather from the Airline production flight search traffic.
Purpose of the internship would then be:
- To study the flight search data stored by Amadeus. These are TeraBytes to dig into with our Big data infrastructure (Hadoop, Spark). Extracted data can be then analysed with traditional data analytics tools (R, Panda...)
- To identify the key performance indicators which should be extracted from this data (e.g. most popular itineraries, stay duration...), as well as the clearest way to present them to the end-user, and summarize this in a high level specifications document to be reviewed with the Product Manager and Product Definition teams
- To design and deliver a prototype with the support of the development team, from the data processing and analysis based on our Business Intelligence platform to a user interface displaying analysis results
 
Requirements
	- 	Communication skills (English)
	- 	Analytical mind
	- 	Technical: knowledge in Hadoop or Spark, data analytics tools (e.g. R) and some UI technology</description>

Whey to Wine is a 3 year project that just started in April 2016.  
The aim of the project is to produce valuable products from whey serum which is currently thrown away.  When processing cheese, whey is produced as a side product which contains 5-6% fermentable lactose sugar. About 45 million liters of whey serum is accumulated annually which could be used to produce about 2 million liters of ethanol.  Its value as raw material for other industries could be about 150 million ISK annually but sold as consumer spirit e.g. “Kusu-Vodka” (Cow-Vodka) its value could rise up to 3000 million ISK.  Environmental beneficial impact would be considerable as the whey serum introduces high organic burden to the environment.  Means for producing ethanol from whey serum are known but large scale industrial production varies between countries and does not exist in Iceland.  The project „Mysa í vín” (Whey to spirit) will select and develop the most suitable large scale production means for Icelandic conditions.

        <description>This internship is for an aspiring lead engineer to take on a strategic role and influence company direction along one of three important strands: AI, Machine Learning or Big Data. 

The purpose of the internship is to work directly with the Lead Engineer on designing and implementing new aspects of the Providence simulation platform. Ideally, the intern would grow into a Lead Engineer role with the company and would lead a team in their domain.

Specific projects to choose from:

Deputy Lead Engineer - Machine Learning 

You will be focused on expanding the platform’s machine learning and network modelling capabilities. This will come in the form of connecting the platform to integrate with other parts of the Hadoop ecosystem. You will also design functionality to enable data mining of IoT sensors or industrial systems. You will be expanding the algorithms for Machine Learning that our platform provides to optimize our client’s solutions. Depending on progress, you will also be working on generalising our distributed calculations framework for large scale simulations. 


Deputy Lead Engineer – Big Data

You will work with the lead engineer to design and build out the platform’s data science functionality. This would involve working with lots of data to figure out the best ways to calibrate our models. We have a formal partnership with Oxford University who specialize in this area. You would work directly with the institute for new economic thinking to embed their research into the platform (see INET Oxford: http://www.inet.ox.ac.uk/). This would be a large part of the project although there would be other opportunities to work on specific client projects if these would be of interest. These projects would primarily involve global financial institutions.

Deputy Lead Engineer – Artificial Intelligence

You will work with the lead engineer on expanding the platform’s AI capabilities. Specifically, you will be designing the strategy to embed AI into large scale distributed simulations. This will involve embedding reinforcement learning (Q-learning for example) into simulations to enable micro level learning. You will also be working on designing and implementing macro learning into simulations so that the modeler can optimize for certain global outcomes. 

Deputy Lead Engineer – Custom Project

For the right candidate, we are willing to tailor an internship around a custom project that’s of interest to the applicant. Note that this is only in exceptional circumstances. 


Currently, Providence is the only enterprise grade, certified simulation platform that runs on Hadoop.

        <description>The project complete the building and testing of an anaerobic digestion test machine. The machine will be modified with pressure transducers, thermocouples, and carbon dioxide measuring devices as needed. Sample biodegradable materials, e.g., food waste, paper, PHA biodegradable plastic will be placed in the test machine and the carbon dioxide will be measured. The concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane will be measured with  a gas chromatograph test machine. Other plastic materials, e.g., PHA, PLA, PCL, and LDPE will be measured for biodegradation after 30 and 60 days. Once a steady stream of methane is produced a heater that is powered by methane will be modified to burn the methane from the digester. The biogas from the digester may be modified with scrubbers to remove the carbon dioxide.

        <description>The student will synthesize the new porous microspheres. These will be used for combined embolization and local release of drugs inside the target tumor. 
This is not a trivial job. We have some ideas about the synthesis of porous microparticles but much of it still must be explored. Most of the work will be in the field of synthetic organic/polymer chemistry. Important other aspects of biomedical engineering (i.e. medical device technology, sterilization, work in a clean room) will be involved as well. If the project proceeds fastly, the student will also examine drug release from the charged porous microspheres in vitro. </description>

        <description>The Mobility, Vehicles, and Electricity Research Lab (Moves-Lab) is seeking talented engineers and software developers for the MyGreenCar project, which aims to accelerate the adoption of sustainable transportation using clean vehicles. Moves-Lab is part of the Grid Integration Group at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, near San Francisco, California.

About MyGreenCar:

Drivers and fleet managers are often unaware of the benefits of clean vehicles, and many are unaware whether these vehicles even meet their personal mobility needs. MyGreenCar seeks to increase the adoption of clean vehicles by enabling drivers and fleet managers to understand whether clean vehicles meet their personal needs, and quantify the magnitude of fuel and cost savings from choosing a clean vehicle. MyGreenCar provides personalized information on how clean vehicles benefit individual drivers based on their unique travel patterns, route-specific terrain and traffic conditions, and driving style. MyGreenCar collects driver mobility data and, via server-side high-fidelity vehicle powertrain models, provides rich personalized information to quantitatively show how a particular clean vehicle will benefit a driver. The MyGreenCar system consists of smartphone applications (Android/Iphone) and a server powered by the Django framework.

About Moves-Lab:

The Mobility, Vehicles, and Electricity System Research Lab (Moves-Lab) conducts R&amp;D to support the development and adoption of cleaner and more efficient vehicles, and enable the integration of these vehicles with larger infrastructure systems. Our research bridges from understanding fundamental phenomena at the powertrain sub-component level, to applying these fundamental phenomena to understand and mitigate impacts at large scales of millions of vehicles. We develop and apply simulation tools, validated by experimental measurements, to examine R&amp;D challenges from the scale of single vehicles or powertrain components, to the integration of many vehicles with infrastructure systems such as the electricity grid.


More important than simply being a collection of research areas, Moves-Lab is a collection of talented, curious, and driven people. Moves-Lab fosters learning and growth for all our team members, provides a forum for exchange of ideas, and provides a foundation for our team to make an impact on society through R&amp;D at the interfaces between mobility, vehicles, and the electricity system. While we all work to enable success in our respective project areas, we keep an open mind to new ideas and new possibilities.

        <description>Gluten-free products are a need for people with celiac disease. Also, there is a new perception among consumers that gluten free products are ?healthier? than the counterpart gluten containing foods. These needs and trends create a great opportunity for expanding the applications of grain sorghum.

The goal of this research project is to develop sorghum tortilla chips (a popular snack in the US usually made with 100% corn) with pre-treated sorghum grains. As a first objective, grain sorghum will be pre-treated with lime, converted into flours, and then used to formulate the chips. The lime pre-treatment, nixtamalization, is used to induce changes in the rheological and structural properties of cereal products, specifically corn and sorghum, which result in improved sensory qualities as well as its nutritional value. Two sorghum varieties-white sorghum and high tannins sorghum-will be used in this study. The second objective will be to evaluate the chemical and sensory characteristics of the different products and determine their nutritional value and acceptability.
The student will experience all the steps involved in scientific research under the close supervision of a laboratory technician and the major professor. Specific skills that the student will lean include literature review, general laboratory skills, data collection and interpretation, and report writing. Skills will be taught by mentoring the student at each step of the research project. First, the student will conduct a literature review on the topic and summarize the results. Second, with the assistance of the mentor, the student will come up with an experimental design and conduct experiments. Third, results will be evaluated after every set of experiments are completed, and the student will be taught to present data in the form of figures, graphs, and tables.
Student performance will be evaluated by following weekly progress of the tasks performed by the student.
Towards the end of the internship, the student will write a final report that will include an introduction, the methods, and results based on standard formats used by scientific journals. If the results are satisfactory, the manuscript will be submitted to a journal for consideration for publication.

        <description>Background: In healthy individuals, somatosensory feedback from the fingertips is integrated with motor commands to ensure successful object manipulation (Zhang et al., 2010). Fundamental aspects of sensorimotor integration can be studied by 1) investigating the principles underlying the mapping between motor commands and affected sensory feedback channels in patients with neuromuscular diseases, e.g., carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) (Zhang et al., 2011-2013, 2015), or in healthy individuals underneath local anesthesia (Carteron et al., 2016), and by 2) quantifying the motor coordination during human-machine interactions in a complex mechanical environments created by a haptic-robotic system.

Objectives: The current study will be pursued through a series of experiments involving participants from healthy subjects to patients with sensorimotor deficits. The objectives of this study is 1) to quantify the role of sensory feedback (i.e., vision, proprioception and tactile inputs) on motor planning and learning; (2) to study the effects of neurological disorders on the CNS's ability to use synergies for controlling complex movements; and (3) to quantify and compare the effects of therapeutic treatments on the recovery of hand function following peripheral neuropathy (e.g., CTS).

        <description>During the internship at Simudyne there would be a strong focus on how to navigate cutting edge technology and acquire valuable engineering skills. There is more than enough material online to learn the basics of almost anything related to programming. You'll be expected to be proactive and research materials online to learn basic concepts. The purpose of the internship is to train you in skills that are not accessible on the internet or are not easily acquired. This will include research and methodologies that the company has developed internally to solve difficult engineering problems. These include things like frameworks to embed artificial intelligence into large scale simulations.
 
Specifically with respect to September, we will be focused on expanding the platform's data science capabilities. This will come in the form of connecting the platform to integrate with other parts of the Hadoop ecosystem. We will also require functionality to enable data mining of IoT sensors or industrial systems. We will also be expanding the algorithms for Machine Learning and AI that our platform provides to optimize our client's solutions. These are the areas that I think would be most relevant for you. We will also be working on generalising our distributed calculations framework which may be of interest to you as many of the calculations are be ML based.
 
Essentially, you'd be working with the lead developer to design and build out the platform's data science functionality. This would involve working with lots of data to figure out the best ways to calibrate the models. We have a formal partnership with Oxford University who specialize in this area. You would work directly with the institute for new economic thinking to embed their research into the platform (see INET Oxford:http://www.inet.ox.ac.uk/). This would be a large part of the project although there would be other opportunities to work on specific client projects if these would be of interest. These projects would primarily involve global financial institutions.

        <description>Osteoarthritis (OA) is the primary disease causing functional disability in Western medicine, the cartilage breakdown can be initiated by the mechanical environment, such as overloading or trauma. To
author's knowledge and up to date, the link between loadings, subchondral bone mechanical properties and pathological process in OA remains an open question. At the microscale the biomechanical properties of the subchondral bone femur in mouse change with OA and we hypothesize that the subchondral bone can be
considered as a marker of OA progression. Coworkers have developed an in vivo loading model in the murine knee (Poulet et al. 2011), in which prescribed loads are applied to the flexed distal hindlimb through loading
cups on the knee and ankle
The goal of this study is to obtain informations on bone mineral crystallinity from Raman spectrum of subchondral bone that is related to bone hardness obtained from Atomic Force Macroscopy. The candidate will performe loading experiment on mice and then characterize the subchondral bone using Raman
spectroscopy and Atomic force microscopy.</description>

        <description>Tuberculosis is one of the top ten causes of death worldwide and the second infectious disease leading to mortality after AIDS. The management of tuberculosis has been complicated by the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains, which constitute the major threat for the control of the pandemic. Mycobacterium tuberculosis produces a broad-spectrum ?-lactamase (BlaC) that limits the efficacy of antibiotics of the ?-lactam family. However, these drugs have regained interest for the treatment of tuberculosis since BlaC was found to be irreversibly inactivated by clavulanate. In most bacteria, the targets of ?-lactams are D,D-transpeptidases belonging to the penicillin-binding protein (PBP) family.  The targets of ?-lactams are unusual in M. tuberculosis since the cross-linking step of cell wall peptidoglycan synthesis is performed by L,D-transpeptidases (LDTs). The latter enzymes are inhibited by ?-lactams of the carbapenem class, such as meropenem, which is active against M. tuberculosis LDTs. In combination with clavulanate, meropenem has recently shown efficacy in a phase II clinical trial. 

Mycobacterium abscessus, a fast growing mycobacterium, is responsible for mortality in cystic fibrosis patients and in the context of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases. The treatment of these lung infections involves imipenem despite the fact that M. abscessus produces a broad-spectrum ?-lactamase (BlaMab), which hydrolyses this carbapenem and is not inhibited by clavulanate. The targets of imipenem in M. abscessus are likely to be LDTs, as discussed above for the LDTs of M. tuberculosis and meropenem. 

The limitations of carbapenems for the treatment of infections due to mycobacteria include a broad antibacterial spectra responsible for adverse effects on the commensal flora, such as opportunistic fungal infections and emergence of broad-spectrum ?-lactamases. In this context, our objective is to obtain new inhibitors active on LDTs but not on PBPs in order to develop drugs that will be active against mycobacteria but devoid of antibacterial activity against members of the commensal flora. We have recently developed the total synthesis of new molecules active on LDTs. The internship will be devoted to the in vitro evaluation of these compounds for the efficacy of inactivation of LDTs and PBPs from mycobacteria. The mechanism of inactivation and the interaction of the compounds with the ?-lactamases BlaC and BlaMab will also be explored. This will involve kinetic analyses of enzyme inhibition by spectroscopic and mass spectrometry techniques. This will also involve the analysis of the 3D structure of the targets to develop the analysis of structure-activity relationships. A last aspect will concern the evaluation of the antibacterial activity of the compounds to determine whether they reach their targets in vivo. The project will contribute to the development of new drugs for the treatment of lung infections due to multi-drug resistant M. tuberculosis and M. abscessus.

        <description>Understanding how cells interact with their environment is of great importance for the development of tissue-engineered therapies. When cells attach to a substrate, they generate traction forces by anchoring to the solid material and contracting. How the material responds to this mechanical stimulus provides important clues for cellular decision-making, driving processes like cell migration, proliferation or differentiation.
Cell traction force microscopy (CTFM) is a powerful technique for measuring the forces generated
by cells on soft materials, and will play a crucial role in developing biomaterials for repair of damaged body tissues. The method involves the tracking of fluorescent beads embedded within
the substrate to measure the displacement fields, followed by the reconstruction of the surface
force exerted by the cell from a mechanical analysis (inverse problem).
The general objective of this project is to develop and validate a computational tool for solving the inverse mechanical problem underlying the CTFM approach.Starting from an existing CTFM program written in
MATLAB, the first stage of the project will involve the systematic veriication of its predictive capabilities. To this end, virtual ?cell-on-substrate? systems will be simulated using the Finite Element Method to generate reference mechanical fields. In the second stage, the CTFM program will be used to analyse mechanical fields in soft substrates induced by real living cells.
This project is key to the development of a reliable CTFM analysis capability within our research groups. It is also expected that the project will bring new insight into cell-substrate interactions.

        <description>Background: In healthy individuals, somatosensory feedback from the fingertips is integrated with motor commands to ensure successful object manipulation (Zhang et al., 2010). Fundamental aspects of sensorimotor integration can be studied by 1) investigating the principles underlying the mapping between motor commands and affected sensory feedback channels in patients with neuromuscular diseases, e.g., carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) (Zhang et al., 2011-2013, 2015), or in healthy individuals underneath local anesthesia (Carteron et al., 2016), and by 2) quantifying the motor coordination during human-machine interactions in a complex mechanical environments created by a haptic-robotic system.

Objectives: The current study will be pursued through a series of experiments involving participants from healthy subjects to patients with sensorimotor deficits. The objectives of this study is 1) to quantify the role of sensory feedback (i.e., vision, proprioception and tactile inputs) on motor planning and learning; (2) to study the effects of neurological disorders on the CNS's ability to use synergies for controlling complex movements; and (3) to quantify and compare the effects of therapeutic treatments on the recovery of hand function following peripheral neuropathy (e.g., CTS).

        <description>The objective of this research is to develop a piezoelectric nanogenerator that will harvest energy from the natural, contractile and relaxation motions of the heart. The nanogenerator will be fabricated from a layer of zinc oxide (ZnO) piezoelectric thin film embedded in polymer materials and will generate power in the milliwatt range. The combination of piezoelectric ZnO thin film properties, novel assembly strategies, and breakthrough device performance parameters suggests that this stretchable device will be a rich platform for fundamental research and novel applications. The nanogenerator will have the thickness in the micrometer scale to be attached on the heart and stretched by the natural heart movements. We expect that energy harvested by the proposed device will be able to power a modern cardiac pacemaker.  At ASRC we plan to deposit ZnO , this is the fabrication step that we will perform.</description>

        <description>Research objective:  the collaborative project (UTC and Waterloo University) has the main objective to assess both functional and anatomical effects of sarcopenia, a muscle aging phenomenon that impacts on motor control and muscle mechanical efficiency. Using a recent multichannel electromyographical technique (HD-SEMG), it is aimed to propose an experimental protocol to record muscle activation of upper limb (Biceps Brachii and Brachialis) and down limb (Rectus Femoris) for two age categories (young and elderly) during isometric isotonic muscle contractions.  These measurements will be performed using a multi-joint ergometer (BIODEX-System 4 Pro) available in the laboratory of Prof. John McPhee and Prof. Ning Jiang from CBB labs. The outcome of the study is the construction of a database of HD-SEMG recordings (up to 256  leads using xxmaterial referencexx) from healthy young and old subjects during isometrics contractions of several intensities and duration to evaluate also the fatigue phenomenon. This experimental database will be after deeply analysed, in a following project, to extract useful information correlated to sarcopenia effects. Another objective should be the evaluation of the balance of aging effects for upper and down limbs.</description>

        <description>Pioneering droplet-based microfluidics, the research interests of our lab are balanced between fundamental research and application. We tackle problems in a diversity of subjects, such as origin of life (including RNA world and protometabolism), evolution of enzyme, digital diagnosis, drug screening, single cell RNA sequencing. 
In this project, we want to investigate the emerging properties of chemical reaction networks compartmentalized in microfluidic droplets. We use the formose reaction, which autocatalytically forms sugars of different sizes from formaldehyde, as model of proto-metabolism. We observed that droplets containing efficient chemistry grow at the expense of others, in the same way that organisms would compete for food. This phenomenon spontaneously gives rise to the equivalent of biological fitness in a synthetic system. For the long run, we envision to demonstrate a rudimentary molecular evolution in a purely physico-chemistry system. 
The internship has two sides: (i) building microfluidic devices and measuring the growth competition between droplets in these devices, using time-lapse microscopy and image analysis; (ii) characterizing of chemical kinetics of formose reaction, using analytical chemistry techniques. 
The student will gain research experience in different disciplines: microfluidics, chemistry, and physico-chemistry, and potentially mathematical modelling. A curiosity and self-motivation in the interdisciplinary research are the assets for the success of the project.</description>

        <description>Laboratory filtration experiments are often conducted for characterization and optimization of filterability,
sample concentration and purification (e.g. valuable products. Filtration plays an important role, e.g. in
processing of submicron- and nano-dispersions that are in the center of current research and product
development. Processing comprises washing, exchange of continuous phase, concentration of dispersed
phase or dewatering. Knowledge of filtration behavior of newly formulated or modified products is essential to
choose and optimize technical filtration units for production processes.
Traditionally, dead-end filtration with compressed air is used in laboratory practice for analysis of filterability
of different samples. However, this technique has numerous disadvantages (not automated, time consuming,
large sample volume required, etc.).
In contrast to dead-end filtration in this work a novel device - multisample analytical filtering centrifuge - is
used for quantitative characterization of filterability of different objects. The device is intended for timesaving
and automated characterization of samples in research and technical laboratories (quality control) and
optimization of industrial filtration processes (dewatering, clarification, membrane separation). The main aim
of this internship is to:
1. Search for relevant information in literature and internet.
2. Optimize the prototype of a multisample analytical filtering centrifuge and test modifications.
Applications.
3. Improving, programming and testing analysis modules in Matlab to process experimental
data.
4. Determine repeatability, reproducibility and accuracy of the new analytical method.

        <description>Our lab recently identified the multifunctional protein E4F1 as a crucial regulator of mitochondrial activity and pyruvate metabolism. More specifically, we found that E4F1 controls the expression of essential subunits and regulators of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex (PDC), a key metabolic enzyme that catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate into Acetyl-CoenzymeA (AcCoA). In agreement with our findings, a homozygote mutation in the human E4F1 gene was recently identified in a family presenting clinical symptoms that resembles those of Leigh syndrome patients. The Leigh syndrome is a rare neurodegenerative disorder that results from mitochondrial defects in pyruvate metabolism or in the electron transport chain. We found that the metabolic reprogramming of E4F1/PDC-deficient cells associates with defects in the production of glucose-derived AcCoA, a key donor of acetyl groups used for protein acetylation. Preliminary data revealed that these cells display decreased protein acetylation, including that of histones. This project aims at determining the acetylome of primary mouse adipocytes and neurons derived from E4f1 knock-out animals using high throughput Mass Spectrometry. This should shed light on the epigenetic changes associated with impaired PDH activity that may translate into specific gene expression signatures. Potential candidates that are differentially acetylated in E4F1-deficient cells will be validated using our genetically engineered mouse models that display E4f1 inactivation specifically in the central nervous system, skeletal muscles or adipose tissue. This work should improve our understanding of the molecular defects associated with PDH deficiency and may lead to the development of more efficient therapeutic strategies for Leigh syndrome patients.

        <description>In visual inspection for small products, operators discriminate between normal and defective products by seeing them after grasping the products by hand. PVI (Peripheral Visual Inspection) method is one that enables operators to execute subconsciously a series of motions including visual sensation, and requires adequate motion learning. In the present research, a PVI training system, which assists their motion learning by presenting tactile sensation based on their vital data involving eye-movement and heart beat fluctuation, is developed.</description>

These devices have proven to effectively lessen muscular activation and therefore reduce the metabolic cost of walking. The most significant drawback of these designs is the depletion of their portable power supplies. Since the goal of these devices is to allow elderly or disabled individuals to function independently, the longevity of the power supply is a major issue. Some exoskeleton devices are designed without the use of a power supply; these are known as passive exoskeletons. These unpowered devices function by harvesting and re-purposing energy within the gait cycle. Since they do not rely on an external power source they can function continuously for an unlimited amount of time, thus truly allowing the wearer to be independent.

This research project propose the development of a proof of concept of a hybrid hip exoskeleton that would leverage the elastic properties of the mechanical springs, dampers and artificial muscles, while minimizing the use of active components. Prototypes will be built at different scales using 3D printers and common manufacturing techniques to test the feasibility of the prototype. A full size prototype will be mechanical tested in a biomechanical laboratory.

Mr. Noam Atlas will first complete a comprehensive literature review on past and current hip exoskeleton. Next, he will develop design concepts for a hip exoskeleton based on a clear and well-defined gait assist strategy. An evaluation of the design ideas will follow to determine the most effective and feasible concept. The selected design will be improved by achieving a kinematic and kinetic analysis and by the production of small-scale 3D printed prototypes. Finally, Mr. Atlas will mechanically test the feasibility of the proposed device. Kinematic and kinetic results obtained from mechanical testing will be used to validate and enhance the proposed design.

Through the proposed project, Noam will receive training in the use of specialized experimental equipment and gait analysis techniques. He will also develop advance skill in biomechanical software such as Visual 3D, LABVIEW and MatLab.</description>

        <description>Splicing factors are crucial regulators of alternative pre-mRNA splicing, a process that contributes to the diversity of the proteome through the generation of different transcripts. It is now well-admitted that cancer cells exhibit abnormal expression of splicing factors but the consequences of such alterations remain largely unknown. We previously showed that some of these proteins, namely SR proteins, are overexpressed in lung tumors as compared to normal lung and that high levels of SR proteins correlate with advanced stages in these tumors (Gout et al., 2012). These results suggested that abnormal expression of SR proteins contribute to lung tumorigenesis. The tumor microenvironment encompasses a wide variety of cells including malignant and non-malignant populations. Non-malignant populations include stromal cells, endothelial cells and a leukocyte infiltrate. Macrophages, also known as Tumor Associated Macrophages (TAM), comprise the dominant portion of the leukocyte population. The presence of extensive TAM infiltration has been shown to correlate with poor prognosis in humans in most studies, thereby suggesting that TAMs are beneficial for tumor growth and disease progression. However, conflicting evidence exists in certain types of cancers, such as in lung tumors where both pro- and anti-tumoral functions of TAMs have been shown. Such discrepancies could be dependent on the various state of activations displayed by these TAMs. In this project, we want to investigate whether it exists a cross-talk between lung tumor cells overexpressing some SR proteins, namely SRSF1, SRSF2 or SRSF6, and macrophages. More precisely, we want to investigate whether SR proteins expressed in tumor cells control signalling pathways involved in tumor escape from phagocytosis by macrophages, like the CD47-SIRP? recognition pathway. In addition, we want to investigate whether the secretome of lung tumor cells overexpressing SR proteins affects TAMs polarization states. Conversely and depending on the results, we will also test whether macrophages are able to modify SR proteins expression and/or activity in lung tumor cells in co-culture experiments. Through the analysis of the ?dialog? between cancer cells and macrophages, this project will allow us to deepen the molecular mechanisms by which deregulated expression of SR proteins in lung tumor cells could contribute to lung tumor progression. This project will be done at the interface of two teams of the Institute For Advanced Biosciences (Head : Pierre Hainaut) in Grenoble. The team « RNA Splicing, Cell Signaling and Response to Therapies » led by Beatrice Eymin and the team « Mechanobiology, Immunity and Cancer » led by Arnaud Millet.

        <description>Bone is an engineering marvel that achieves a unique combination of stiffness and toughness exceeding that of synthetized materials. Evidence suggests that the intermolecular forces that involve the two main bone building blocks - Tropocollagen molecules (TC) and carbonated hydroxyapatite (cAp) - are the main contributors to its mechanical behavior but their direct contributions remain unclear.To date, most bone biomechanics studies have been done on mammalian bone but its complex ultrastructure and remodeling process make it difficult to precisely describe the intermolecular forces between TC and cAp. 
	Intramuscular bone of Atlantic Herring (IM AH) appears to be one of the best materials in terms of mechanical competence (Fig.1) without presenting a complex ultrastructure or remodeling process available and their crystal composition and mechanical behavior can be explored with our high resolution imaging and mechanical techniques.The hypotheses are that intermolecular forces depends on the characteristics of TC and cAp themselves and that IM AH's simple structure makes possible a comprehensive experimental investigation of these characteristics. To do so, we investigate ex vivo IM AH bones that span a wide spectrum of maturation steps, and then determine:
- 	Collagen Crosslinking (CXL) using ultra-high resolution Mass-Spectrometry (LC-MS), 
- 	NCPs using electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), Stains-All stain, and western immunoblotting. 
- 	Stiffness, Strength, Toughness using high precision micro tensile tests,
This project will combine experimental tools available at Dr. Berteau lab at City University of New-York, CSI), at the Advances Sciences Research Center and at Pr Poget Lab at (LC-MS).
Internship objective: The goal of this project is to investigate the role of the collageneous and non collageneous protein on the mechanical response of bone tissue in fish bone and to establish a new biomarkers of bone fragility.  
Requested competences: Bachelor's degree in Engineering (preferably in Chemical or Biomedical) Experimental (testing machine) and strong interpersonal and organizational skills are mandatory.Starting date: To be determined with candidate Contact: jean.berteau@csi.cuny.edu

        <description>The aim of the project is to develop microbes and anaerobic microbial processes applying marine
microalgae feedstock for production of health promoting bioactive ingredients in feed. Special
emphasis is on seaweed derived feed products enriched in protein, organic acids, prebiotic
oligosaccharides and phenolic compounds that in conjunction with probiotic microbes have beneficial
influence on gut health (synbiotics). Different types of whole seaweed will be processed and different
types of fermenting bacteria used. Fermenting seaweed increases digestibility, facilitate the access to
bioactive ingredients in the seaweed the thereby enhances the bioactive properties and health
promoting effects.
 
The fermented seaweed project involves microbiology, sugar analytics, enzyme processing and microbiome characterization by MiSeq sequence analysis.
Further, the project involves a process and product development.
This project has started and we already have some interesting results and interesting experiments are ahead.
This project would probably give you a more complete story in six months compared to the virus project.

        <description>The French student will develop a capacitive sensing system that will be designed with two sensing cuffs that can measure the leg muscle shape changes during walking. The system can be dressed above the clothes and free human skin from contacting to electrodes. In order to track the capacitance signals produced by leg movements, the capacitor will have two flexible electrodes fabricated in the laboratory of Prof Voiculescu and applied on the leg.
After the implementation of the whole system on the walking foot, we will evaluate the system performance by experiments with twelve healthy subjects walking on treadmill with changing speeds. Our goal is to achieve accurate and consistent gait phase estimation with only one channel of capacitance signal. The gait is the manner of waling or moving the foot.

        <description>The objective of this research is to develop a wearable piezoelectric nanogenerator that will harvest energy from the movements of the body. The nanogenerator will be fabricated from a layer of zinc oxide (ZnO) piezoelectric thin film embedded in polymer materials and will generate power in the milliwatt range. The combination of piezoelectric ZnO thin film properties, novel assembly strategies, and breakthrough device performance parameters suggests that this stretchable device will be a rich platform for fundamental research and novel applications. The nanogenerator will have the thickness in the micrometer scale to be attached on the body or cloth and will be stretched by the movements of the body. We expect that energy harvested by the proposed device will be able to power wearable sensors.  The nano generator was already fabricated in the research laboratory of Professor Voiculescu. Tristan will learn how to fabricate the sensor and also how to characterize the output power from the sensor. </description>

        <description>We previously identified in six patients from three unrelated kindred suffering of multiple infections and allergies the first human deficiency in RLTPR (Wang et al., 2016). The patients have low number of CD4 and CD8 T cells, of regulatory T cells and memory B cells. Interestingly we showed that RLTPR is expressed in control lymphocytes (B, T and NK cells) and in some myeloid subsets but was poorly expressed or absent in patient cells. As reported in the mouse model (Liang et al., 2013), we demonstrated that RLTPR plays a crucial role in CD28 costimulation of T cell receptor (TCR) signaling, bridging CD28 with the NF?B pathway. Interestingly, we also showed that BCR signaling was at least partly impaired in RLTPRdeficient patients, since their B cells stimulated with an anti-IgM fail to activate NF?B signaling. Both T and B cell intrinsic deficiencies underlie patient susceptibility to infections. 

We recently identified new patients with RLTPR deficiency. The project will consist in: 
1- Validate the genetic analysis in the new kindred 
2- Characterize the new alleles in an overexpression system (expression, dimerization...) 
3- Establish an in vitro system to test RLTPR alleles function 
4- Perform an immunological phenotyping of the new patients cells and test their T and B cell function following CD28 and IgM activation, respectively. 
5- Study in depth the role of RLTPR in B cell function. 
6- Rescue a phenotype in patients derived B and T cells using a lentivirus. </description>

        <description>Our project focuses on the mitochondrial respiratory chain, which is responsible for the energy production in the cell.
ATP production is particularly critical in brain since neurons have important needs in energy but a limited glycolysis, making them highly dependent on OXPHOS and more vulnerable to mitochondrial dysfunction. CI dysfunction is the most common OXPHOS disorder and defects in the CI assembly process are often observed. Interestingly, CI is highly perturbed in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and moreover, their mitochondria contain high levels of b-amyloids (one of the hallmarks of AD). The pathogenesis of AD is still unknown and big efforts are being invested to identify the factors driving AD pathogenesis in order to find better ways to diagnose and treat AD, delay its onset, and prevent disease progression. Therefore, how this mitochondrial complex malfunctioning affects neuronal integrity remains a major open question. Along this line, our second goal is to unveil the interplay between MCIA dysfunction and amyloid pathology in brain mitochondria and in the early stages of AD. We carry out functional studies of the MCIA proteins in neuronal cells and AD-like cell models using cell biology assays, particularly immunofluorescence.

Overall, our aim is to elucidate the structure of the MCIA complex and determine its functional significance in amyloid pathology.

During the six-month traineeship, Anaïs will be involved in the different steps of the experimental pipeline to determine the molecular structure of the MCIA protein complex and the atomic structure of individual proteins or in subcomplex:

1. Expression of recombinant proteins at large scale in prokaryotic systems, such as E.coli
2. Protein purification by chromatographic methods
3. Biochemical and biophysical characterization of purified protein samples and protein complex evaluation (i.e. homogeneity, monodispersion, stability) by standard techniques such as calorimetry, thermal shift assays, circular dicroism, light scattering, mass spectrometry, negative stain electron microscopy ...
4. Protein-protein interaction screening by yeast two-hybrid methods and native gel electrophoresis
5. Protein crystallization trials by vapour diffusion method
6. X-ray diffraction of protein crystals using synchrotron radiation source (Structural Biology crystallography beamlines) to determine the protein structure at atomic resolution
7. Molecular structure determination of protein complexes by cryo-electron microscopy and small-angle X-ray scattering (Structural Biology Titan Krios microscope and BioSAXS beamlines)

With this traineeship, Anaïs will acquire laboratory hands-on experience in molecular and structural biology. She will be trained in large-scale protein expression and purification suitable for structural biology analyses, such as X-ray crystallography and single particle electron microscopy. She will also learn how to evaluate protein stability and protein complex formation using biochemical and biophysical methods, available in our laboratory and in the European Photon &amp; Neutron Science (EPN) campus. In case the protein samples crystallize, she will be trained in initial X-ray diffraction crystal analysis for subsequent structure determination. In parallel, the molecular structure of the protein complex will be determined in solution using cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray scattering methods.

During her traineeship, she will also receive continuous support and training from the laboratory members involved in the project. In addition, she will participate in hands-on training activities and scientific seminars, with privileged access to lectures and tutorials. The EPN campus offers many workshops and practical courses. With these activities, Anaïs will acquire skills in scientific communication and writing</description>

        <description>The student will work on modelling and analysis of household energy
consumption data. The objective is to understand the effects of climate, construction types, appliance types,
appliance efficiency, and occupant behaviour on household energy consumption. Dominant factors influencing
energy consumption will be identified and their relationship will be modelled. The outcome will be compared to that
derived by using macroscopic (i.e. community- or city-aggregated data). The outcomes will form a basis for
projection of future household energy consumption under scenarios taking into account possible climate change as
well as policy and regulation changes.</description>

--------------------------------------------------------------
Mind provides services/consultancy in the domain of embedded software, with a focus on free software in low-level, networking, security and multimedia.

There are currently 25 engineers in the company . Most of them are on-site at the customer. 3 engineers are here permanently and these are the people the student will collaborate with. In addition, the other engineers are regularly in house as well, and the student will collaborate with most of them. The idea is that all the engineers get familiar with this project. We have an internal meeting every two weeks and after that meeting there is also time and opportunity to interact with the other colleagues.

The tasks will include :
* Look for different off-the-shelf hardware options and select one. The hardware will be an ARM-based SoC with lots of peripherals. We might look into a SoC-FPGA, though that's not certain at all.
* Take a look at the different possible software tools, and select the ones which will be applicable.
* The OS will be Linux. Also the Device Under Test (DUT) will mostly be Linux.
* The system itself will be built either with Buildroot or with Debian.
* There will be a number of interfacing technologies to be integrated. 
For sure UART, I2C, Ethernet and WiFi. Possibly Bluetooth, USB, PCIe, SPI, and many others.
* There will also be electronics involved, e.g. for level conversion, power supply, ... This will mostly be soldering/breadboarding, but possibly also PCB design.
* All code will be in git on gitlab.&quot;

        <description>In this research we will develop a lab on chip device to conduct a set of complementary in vitro experiments to study the coronary artery calcification process. We plan to study the influence of the substrate smoothness on the endothelial cells. We will manufacture cell culture chambers equipped with smooth and rough substrates and electrical impedance sensors for monitoring the culturing endothelial cells under flow. We will culture endothelial cells under flow and compare their behavior on substrates mimicking the smooth or rough surfaces. We will begin our study on human umbilical vein endothelial cells, termed HUVEC (ATCC® PCS-100-010?), which will be obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). Flow chambers will be manufactured in the laboratory of Ioana Voiculescu using PDMS and well-established fabrication techniques. The growth surfaces will be patterned with hemispheres manufactured by surface tension assisted lithography method. The coronary artery calcification process will be studied based on experiments conducted using this lab on a chip. 
WORK TO BE DONE BY THE STUDENT: 	
Fabricate smooth substrate for cell culturing	
Fabricate rough growth surfaces patterned with hemispheres manufactured by surface tension assisted lithography method Fabricate microfluidic channels on top of the smooth and rough substrates.	
Fabricate electrodes inside the microfluidic channel for impedance spectroscopy measurements
Culture HUVEC cells and study the influence of surface roughness on endothelial cells
Conduct impedance spectroscopy measurements on the HUVEC cells in culture

INTERNSHIP JOB DESCRIPTION - 3 to 6 months 
Smart Innovative Operations Center 
  
Air   Liquide   is   the   worldwide   leader   for   gases   for   industry,   health,   and   associated  technologies   and   services.   It   is   present   in   80   countries   with   65,000   employees   worldwide.   Its  revenue is more than 20 billion euro in 2017. 
 
Context 
  
Based   in   Kuala   Lumpur,   the   Smart   Innovative   Operations   Center   is   gradually   being   connected  to 18 units producing gases for industry and health in South East Asia and the Pacific.  
 
In the production units, the teams are able to focus on equipment safety and performance: 
? control and drive production 24/7 
? in parallel, adjust energy consumption in real time 
? conduct predictive maintenance actions 
 
Like   a   control   tower,   the   center's   teams   monitor   on-screen   all   the   oxygen,   nitrogen,   argon and   hydrogen   needs   of   customers   in   South   East   Asia   (SEA).   They   adjust   the   production   of   all  units   in   real   time   to   meet   customer   demand,   whether   they   are   continuously   supplied   by  pipeline   or   delivered   by   a   fleet   of   more   than   150   trucks.   Production   instructions   are  transmitted   remotely   via   secure   networks,   enabling   teams   to   start   up   a   unit,   set   production  levels, or stop production.  
 
Thanks   to   this   technology,   Air   Liquide   is   improving   the   energy   efficiency   of   its   own  installations   by   reducing   CO2   emissions   as   much   as   possible.   Using   big   data   analytics,   the  operating   center   teams   identify   the   most   efficient   settings   for   each   production   unit   in   a   bid  to   save   energy.   When   electricity   consumption   peaks   in   the   SEA   cluster,   the   operation   center  adjusts   the   various   production   volumes   of   each   unit   to   meet   the   demand   of   industrial  customers,   achieving   the   best   energy   efficiency   depending   on   the   geographic   area  
concerned. 
 
 
Missions 
 
The   intern   will   be  working   in   the   Smart   Manufacturing   Technology   team,   together   with   a  Senior   data   scientist   and   with   the   support   of   Industrial   IT   experts.   He   will   develop   tools   and  methods to: 
- clean data sets prior to optimization 
- try new optimization algorithms 
- implement innovative predictive and machine learning methods 
- prepare dedicated dashboards 
- develop training material for these new tools 
 
Competencies 
? R studio, Python 
? SQL 
? Tableau, powerBI

        <description>Accelerometers are carried out on the geodetic missions CHAMP and GRACE for studying the Earth's gravity field. These satellites were launched in 2000 and 2002 respectively and have built up a complete database of the thermosphere in terms of geographical and temporal cover. These data have considerable value for modelling, particulary if they can be improved by modifying the algorithms, using more representative indices of solar and geomagnetic activity and better pre-processing. In case of GRACE, the large number of attitude manoeuvres disturbs the derived density of the accelerometry measurements and requires smoothing or filtering so as to preserve atmospheric variations as fully as possible.

The assignment will consist in deriving, analysing and pre-processing atmospheric densities and then using them to estimate the coefficients of the Digital Terrain Model and to evaluate its accuracy (with a full error budget)</description>

        <description>Degenerative disorders (such as muscle tears and osteoarthritis) of shoulder joint remains a common problem that leads to  limited joint functions, continuous pain and potential need for  a surgery. Unfortunately, the mechanisms involved in such failures are poorly understood to date. Recently, several radiological studies show that diversities in the individual patient anatomy might be used as a good predictor of degenerative changes in the glenohumeral joint. However the mechanical effect of variations in patient's anatomy is very difficult, if not impossible, to investigate in-vivo. For this reason, musculoskeletal modelling is an interesting avenue to explore this hypothesis. 
The main goal of the whole project is to build and validate a parametric numerical model of the shoulder joint to simulate daily-life movements. The term ?parametric? is used in the sense that the model will count for variations in patients morphology. This specific part of the project will address the simulation of various scapular morphotypes and  statistical analysis of results. 
In the model, we will change parameters such as: 1)  the inclination of the glenoid fossa and 2) the lateral extension of the acromion, which in combination also changes the value of a parameter called the critical shoulder angle [1]. Then we will analyze the effect of those changes on muscle moment arms and forces, glenohumeral joint reaction force and translation of the humeral head in the glenoid fossa. Finally, we will discuss our results with a current state of arts form the literature.

        <description>The team focuses its studies on spinocerebellar degenerations, which include hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSP) or SPG. Affected subjects show slowly progressive lower-limb spasticity (stiff legs and hyperreflexia) resulting from degeneration of the corticospinal tract, leading to important disability and sometimes to premature death (Tesson et al, 2015). They are clinically classified according to the absence (uncomplicated or pure HSP) or presence (complicated or complex HSP) of additional neurological or extra- neurological signs. This clinical heterogeneity partially underlies the large genetic heterogeneity of this group of disorders where more than 70 genes have been identified, coding for proteins involved in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) morphogenesis, microtubule dynamics and transport, mitochondrial quality control, and endosomal functions (Finsterer et al, 2012). During the last 5 years, work done in the team pinpointed the link between new mutations found in HSP patients and lipid and membrane metabolism (Tesson et al, 2012; Martin et al, 2013; Boukhris et al, 2013, Marelli et al, 2017). Among these genes, KIF1C1 was identified mutated in families with various geographical origins by the host group.
Mutations of kinesins, important molecular motors that directionally transport various cargoes, including membranous organelles, protein complexes and mRNA, are associated with several forms of hereditary spastic paraplegias (SPG) and a dozen of KIF1C mutations, mostly in the motor domain, are associated to SPG58 and spastic ataxia (SAX2) in humans. We have also reported in cattle that similar mutations in KIF1C gene are associated to the same clinical symptoms as in human. The biological material allows us to precise the molecular and cellular mechanism in this demyelinating disease. We have also generated deficient Kif1c mutant mouse. The mice are under first characterizations however they manifest many motor and muscular defects.
The objectives of this project are :

i)	to decipher the neuronal (myelinisation and maintenance of myelinisation) and muscular phenotypes of this new mouse model 
ii)	to assess if this phenotype is absent when the gene is transcriptionally silenced (KO model) in vivo and thus to distinguish between gain- and loss-of-function effects 
iii)	to assess the affected biological pathways, looking in particular at the potential partners of WT and N-terminally truncated Kif1c proteins in both tissues, trying to find the determinants of the dominant and recessive phenotypes.
The candidate will be involved more particularly in work package I).

        <description>Introduction
The field of cellular cancer immunotherapy is rapidly emerging. Several new concepts have reached the clinic and an array of innovations are currently being explored in pre-clinical studies 1. Most of these new approaches focus on augmenting the tumor killing capacity by the immune cells. This is exemplified by the successful implementation of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) approaches as well as the use of bispecific antibodies and of immune check-point inhibitors 2. However, today, few studies have focused on the potential of specifically homing adoptively infused immune cells to the tumor-bearing tissue and thereby more efficiently target the cancer 3,4. The lack of such approaches is likely linked to our relatively poor understanding of the complex orchestra of chemokine receptors and chemokines as well as integrins that are involved in transmigration and homing of cells 5. Moreover, methods for careful in vivo tracking of adoptively infused immune cells has for long been unavailable or limited. To be able to further understand, improve and develop new cellular cancer immunotherapy approaches, including those focusing on proper homing of adoptively infused immune cells, we here aim at optimizing methods for in vivo homing and tracking of lymphocytes. In order to ensure this, we would like to use new molecular methods such as CRISPR/Cas9 and homologous recombination (HR) as well as establishing a pipeline for producing a number of mRNAs coding for key chemokine receptors and integrins. With these technologies established, we hope to be better equipped to address what signals that are involved in migration of immune cells to a given organ and also learn how these cells can be modified for improved and/or selected in vivo homing to further augment the efficacy of cellular cancer immunotherapy.


Objective
The overall aim of this project is to establish new gene techniques to be used in studies on in vivo tracking and selective homing of adoptively infused immune cells. To have such tools ready for evaluation in pre-clinical animal models is key to develop new cancer immunotherapy approaches.

Aim 1: Establish the production of DNA templates for homologous recombination
Aim 2: Optimize CRISPR/Cas9 and HR in lymphocytes
Aim 3: Streamline the production of in-house mRNAs for efficient transfection of lymphocytes


Project description
The student will be supervised by PI Mattias Carlsten and post-doc Melanie Lambert. Collectively, the two supervisors have experience from immunology, cell biology and molecular biology, including vector cloning and the use of CRISPR/Cas9. All methods and infrastructure needed to successfully complete this project are available.

Time plan
The project will be carried out during 6 months, with Aim 1 and 3 conducted in parallel over the first 2-3 months and Aim 2 will be carried out the last 3-4 months. A report will be written in the end of the project.

Ethical considerations
Ethical approval for the use of peripheral blood lymphocytes from anonymous healthy donor is in place (Dnr 2006/229-31/3). None of the cells will be injected into humans. 

Significance
We are facing a new era in cancer immunotherapy. This proposal aims at developing new molecular tools in order to modify and track immune cells and improve their homing capacity.

        <description>Osteoarthritis (OA) is the primary disease causing functional disability in Western medicine (Guccione et al., 1994), the cartilage breakdown can be initiated by the mechanical environment, such as overloading (Martin et al., 2013) or trauma (Marijnissen et al., 2002; Mastbergen et al., 2008). To author's knowledge and up to date, the link between loadings, subchondral bone mechanical properties and pathological process in OA remains an open question. We hypothesize that high fluid pressure is cartilage-protective and high matrix stress is cartilage-destructive, our results will give insights to osteoarthritis  mechanism of progression.
We have developed an in vivo loading model in the murine knee (Shefelbine et al. 2014 ; Poulet et al. 2011), in which prescribed loads are applied to the flexed distal hindlimb through loading cups on the knee and ankle.

Internship objective: The goal of this study is to investigate from mechanical test, biological investigation and other data to detect OA progression.

        <description>Mines, utility tunnels, and caves would benefit from a fleet of UAV that could quickly explore complex environments without being challenged by the obstacles on the ground (rocks, stairs, ladders, etc.). 
However, both localization (absence of GPS signal) and communications are hindered by the surrounding environment. In particular, communications may be seriously degraded by the absence of line of sight among the UAVs. 

In this project, we are interested in a scenario in which a human operator remotes control the fleet leader in while the other members of the fleet autonomously adjust their position to maintain the connectivity chain between the operator and the leader with uncertain localization and an unknown environment. The same connectivity chain would be useful also to relay and deliver real-time images and videos from the interior of the explored place to the operator.

The objective of the internship is to join the ongoing projet to develop and test algorithms so that a fleet of UAVs can maintain intra-fleet connectivity as well as inter-fleet communication with an external operator, in unknown underground environments and with limited localization precision. The validation of the algorithms will be achieved through simulations and real-field small-scale tests (Crazyflie micro-UAV).</description>

        <description>Mr. Galez would work under the close supervision and daily guidance of Dr. Françoise M. Roelants (Ph.D., Univ. of Strasbourg, France), who has been my Research Specialist since 1999. Mr. Galez will contribute to our on-going studies of the TORC2-Ypk1 signaling axis in the model eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae (budding yeast) and, in the course of these studies will apply fundamental concepts and practical methods in biochemistry, molecular genetics, recombinant DNA technology, and various cell imaging techniques.
We have identified a transcription factor (Smp1) as a likely physiologically relevant target of the TORC2-Ypk1 signaling pathway.  It well be Mr. Galez'project to confirm that Smp1 is a substrate of Ypk1 both in vitro and in vivo, that Ypk1-mediated phosphorylation affects some aspect of Smp1 function (stability, nucleocytoplasmic distribution, DNA-binding capacity, association with other proteins, the profile of genes under its control, etc.)</description>

        <description>Pancreatic beta cells cope with variable metabolic insulin demand by constitutive and inducible engagement of the unfolded protein response (UPR). According to recent results, the UPR not only increases insulin folding and secretion capacity but can also induce beta cell proliferation through an unknown mechanism. Our collaborator Peter Van Endert (University Paris Descartes) has found that deletion of a beta cell protease dramatically upregulates both the UPR and the ensuing proliferative response. In this project, granted by the French Agence Nationale de la Recherche, we will study the pathway linking this protease and stress-induced proliferation. More specifically the aim of the internship will be to establish the optimal conditions to screen on protease -/- MIN6 cells the siGENOME SMARTpool siRNA library targeting 19,061 genes of the whole mouse genome, searching for genes the inhibition of which leads to a decrease in cell survival. Cell proliferation will be monitored by fluorescent microscopy in a High Content Screening miniaturized assay. Images will be acquired on the automated HCS platform Imaginex (Pasteur Institute of Lille) and analysed with the Columbus software to obtain quantitative data for multiple parameters. Once the method will be developed, the screen will be performed and hit genes will then be explored in more specific secondary assays. We anticipate that this project might help to identify pharmacological targets suitable for exploiting the protective potential of the UPR in beta cells and possibly in other cells and tissues. Next to its interest in advancing our comprehension of stress responses, the results of the project could more directly concern several important pathologies, like type 2 diabetes. </description>

        <description>One of the most promising approaches to repair the injured tissues is to use a tissue engineering method that combines implantable materials and cells. For instance, recent new bone substitutes combine stiff scaffolds and bone cells. Unfortunately, their scaffold lack of toughness and fail for mimicking bone mechanical competence. Regarding bone mechanical competence, bone presents a specific combination of high stiffness, high toughness and high strength that we currently fail to reproduce in vitro. This astonishing combination is the result of a self-assembly process involving proteins and minerals. However, mechanics of this self-assembly process are not fully understood and there is a pivotal lack of knowledge about how bone cells' protein control bone mineralization. This lack of knowledge is one of the major obstacles to synthesizing bone-like material in tissue engineering.  
Investigate the role of the collageneous and no collageneous protein on the mechanical response of bone tissue in new soft gel and to build a first bone-like material. Determine the patterns of proteins production-inhibitors and nucleators of mineralization - by bone cells through mechanical stimuli. Control the mineralisation process of our new scaffold to reach a combination of high stiffness, high toughness and high strength</description>

        <description>Lung cancer is the most lethal cancer worldwide. This is why we need to deepen the mechanisms involved in lung tumor progression in order to develop alternative therapeutic strategies. It is now well-known that the tumor microenvironment contributes to tumorigenesis. Tumor microenvironment encompasses a wide variety of cells including malignant and non-malignant populations. Non-malignant populations include stromal cells, endothelial cells and a leukocyte infiltrate. Macrophages, also known as Tumor Associated Macrophages (TAM) in this context, comprise the dominant portion of the leukocyte population. The presence of extensive TAM infiltration has been shown to correlate with poor prognosis in humans in most studies, thereby suggesting that TAMs are beneficial for tumor growth and disease progression. However, conflicting evidence exists in certain types of cancers, such as in lung tumors where both pro- and anti-tumoral functions of TAMs have been shown. Such discrepancies could be dependent on the various state of activations displayed by these TAMs. Therefore, a better understanding of how the cross-talk between lung tumor cells and macrophages takes place is needed as targeting this cross-talk could be a way to inhibit tumor growth. For this project, we want to develop an original 3D co-culture (macrophages + tumor cells) system to closely mimick what does exist in lung cancer patients. In these 3D co-culture models, lung tumor cells grown in spheroids will be cultured in the presence or absence of primary human macrophages. Recruitment of macrophages inside or at the periphery of spheroids, tumor cells proliferation and migration as well as the status of macrophages polarisation will be evaluated in these 3D models mainly by confocal microscopy and immunofluorescence studies. This project will be done at the interface of two teams of the Institute For Advanced Biosciences (Head: Pierre Hainaut) in Grenoble. The team « RNA Splicing, Cell Signaling and Response to Therapies » led by Beatrice Eymin and the team « Mechanobiology, Immunity and Cancer » led by Arnaud Millet.

- Co-culture (macrophages + tumor cells) experiments
- Cell viability assays
- Confocal microscopy, videomicroscopy

Abstract:
Development of magnetically navigated catheter and capsule robot for microsurgery and drug delivery.
Micro- and nano-robotic technologies show a great deal of promise for Medical applications. As an example, microrobots for endoscopic procedures have been researched extensively and have been shown to be feasible. One of the current limitations of these systems is that they rely on a hard-wired system to provide propulsion power. Our research focuses on the design and control of magnetically driven MEMS robotic systems. By controlling a magnetic field we are able to freely control the (x,y,z) position of a magnetizable or magnetic object. The key benefit of this system is that the propulsive power is provided external to the robot. This greatly reduces the amount of on-board power for the system and can provide a significant decrease in weight and size, and increase in system up-time.
A magnetically driven robotic system could be used in the surgical field for highly localized drug delivery. A MEMS robot placed inside the vascular or digestive system could be tracked using magnetic sensors and commanded to move to a very specific point in the body. Once there a command signal would cause the robot to release a medical agent into the system. Such a procedure could reduce the risks associated with procedures such as chemotherapy, which can adversely affect healthy organs and tissues due to their more generalized application. Furthermore, the robot can be equipped with various MEMS sensors in order to monitor local and vital parameters (e.g. temperature, pressure) inside human body.
We have developed magnetically navigated microrobots that can perform pick-and-place tasks remotely. This concept can be applied for medical application in which a capsule robot to navigate in human body and deliver drugs at specific location (e.g. tumors). Also a smart catheter can be developed based on a recently granted patent: ?United States Issued Patent US9689934B2, Behrad Khamesee and Moein Mehrtash - 'Method for providing force information in a magnetic field environment using remote measurement of flux', June 27, 2017?. We are able to navigated s chatter that is equipped with a patented force sensing technology.</description>

        <description>Nowadays software applications include more and more open-source (OSS) libraries. At the same time, the number of vulnerabilities being discovered and publicly disclosed for OSS libraries is ever-increasing. 
The gains obtained from the reuse of community-developed libraries may be offset by the cost of establishing a timely and effective vulnerability management process that allows organizations to identify, assess and mitigate vulnerabilities in open-source software. The consequences of poor vulnerability management are
demonstrated by the severe security incidents that appear in the news with alarming frequency: breaches, such as the one suffered by Equifax in 2017, can have major legal, financial, and societal impacts.

Existing tools tackling such problem rely on metadata to map OSS libraries to vulnerabilities and thus suffer from both false positives and false negatives. The solution developed at SAP is instead code-centric and combines static and dynamic analysis to determine the reachability of the vulnerable portion of libraries used (directly or transitively) by an application. The implemented tool supports the analysis of Java and Python applications, is the officially recommended tool at SAP and has been recently open-sourced.

The goal of this internship is divided into two parts. The first one targets the automation for the creation of the environment used by the vulnerability-assessment-tool inside SAP. This task ranges from creating machines in our OpenStack deployment to connecting them and spinning up working replicas. Tools that could be used to achieve this automation are Ansible, Terraform or others. The second part of the internship is more explorative and sees the candidate experimenting with Kubernetes, trying to port our Dockerized infrastructure completely into a k8s cluster.

        <description>Team and context description

Shaping the future of travel is important to us at Amadeus. Today, with technology getting smarter by the minute, that future is more exciting than ever. Our business success relies on our people being always passionate about what we do. We believe in aiming for excellence, taking responsibility, working together and putting our customers first.  

The department R&amp;D-FOR-SEC is the torchbearer of Amadeus flagship front-office product: Amadeus Selling Platform Connect that is a one-stop shop for global Amadeus, and regional or local content, designed for the needs of the user and the business.  

In addition, we firmly believe in innovation and cutting edge technologies to enable our day-to-day business and improve the efficiency and quality of life within all the teams. 


Purpose of the internship
The internship will be around one such innovative tool called Health Check that provides a unique viewport on useful KPIs; be it the status of code bugs (PTRs) or teams organization or various KPIs of Selling Platform Connect like deployed users per market, performance times etc. These KPIs are depicted using tree-view graphs in a hierarchical manner.  

For example, for bug's graph each team node shows: number of items, severity, days taken to fix etc. and this is then depicted for the hierarchy of teams?department? division etc.

This tool has been developed with angular v6 and node.js and mongo DB.

The internship will cover all the aspects of making Health Check module as generic (newGen) as possible and work on the history aspects of data presented.  


Key missions 
- 	The trainee will propose the necessary upgrade for Health Check that will allow adding new graphs and configuring the existing ones on the fly (via UI interface).  For instance, adding new KPIs by just managing the data source and the configuration of how that data will be presented in the UI. This will also involve elaborating the details panel, that will give detailed information of selected nodes' KPIs.
- 	The second main aspect would be to work on the history of data represented in any of the graphs, where a basic version exists and needs further development. This will also require analysis of the KPI data to find the optimal way of representing the history graphs.

What you will learn
- 	Meet involved stakeholders including the Product Owner, who is none other than the department head.
- 	Analyze requirements and document them via user stories backlog.
- 	Design and code the user stories and present them during sprint demos.
- 	Validate that the tool/module is working as expected as per the acceptance criteria.

        <description>1/ The student will participate in the H2020 Virus-X. The aim of the project is to explore the sequence space of thermophilic viruses. Viral and bacterial metagenomes (VirMet) from Icelandic hot springs have been prepared sequenced, assembled and annotated. Viral genes have been identified, cloned and expressed. The majority of the viral proteins cannot be assigned to a specific function as they are distantly related to known proteins. Selected recombinant products assigned as hypothetical proteins have been subjected for crystallization. Other protein will be subjected to functional screening. The objective is to develop enzymes for molecular applications.

The student will produce selected recombinant proteins
From metagenomes of thermophilic viruses (phages) of unknown function on a small scale. He will purify the proteins (chromatography) and carry out DNA binding assays. Further, simple functional assays will be performed for potential determination of activity. Stability will be studied by applying fluorescent stains. Promising candidate
Proteins will be produced in larger volumes for further characterization

2/ Recently, Matis and collaborators showed that enzymes of family GH17 from proteobacteria catalyse transfer reactions with laminarioligosaccharides (β -glucan) generating (β1-3) (β1-6) and even (β1-4) linkages. The enzyme designated Glt20 is a true β-glucan branching enzyme, generating (β1-6) linkage. It is of industrial interest as it can be used for producing potent bioactive branched β-glucan oligosaccharides for different applications.
In this project, the student will produce Glt20 in a 10-litre fermenter. Further, he will prepare substrates for the Glt20 enzyme by further purifying laminarin polysaccharides extracted from seaweed by Matis and digesting them into oligosaccharides of dp5-10 applying β-glucanases (Matis proprietary enzymes). Subsequently, the resulting oligosaccharides will be incubated with the Glt20. Different products will be obtained by incubating the enzyme/substrate mixture for different periods. The student will be supervised in the laboratory by Matis‘s specialists.
In a continued study in collaboration with Matis partners, the resulting products, with different proportion of β-1,6 linkages depending on incubation time, will be analysed with respect to structure and immunomodulating activity.

        <description>We would like to propose an internship related to Biosensors with target application in Hepathology. More precisely, our goal is to develop a mass-fabrication technology for the monitoring of hyponatremia of cirrhotic patients. This includes nanoscale transistors, a microfluidics part and packaging. One challenge is to check the multi-scale mechanical strength of the proposed device including nanometric oxide layers, the microfluidics channel and the 3D printed peek package to avoid any leakage and get a reusable device.
The internship will consist in modeling, testing and finding some optimum conditions, test the fabricated devices under operation. In particular, the newly purchased 3D peek printer (Funmat HT), that is expected to be particularly useful for the implementation of a reusable and integrated chip, will be used to align high-temperature 3D printed PEEK microfluidic channels on silicon nanotransistor chips and to perform microfluidic diluters and filters. Electrical measurements on the developed nanotransistor-based chip will be performed with an existing and automated electrical measurement setup. Several sensor approaches will be tested.

        <description>This internship targets identifying and recommending best strategic improvement projects targeting overall efficiency in the full value chain from inquiry to delivery. Special attention shall be given to streamlining of our mechanical workshop.
 
The project shall review the current manufacturing development strategy and estimate the effects from executing the current strategy in terms of cost improvement per piece, lead-time reduction as well as inventory reduction.
 
Current state shall be analysed by Value stream mapping. Moreover, new ideas for improvement should be developed by conducting workshops with the production/logistic team. The effects from implementing these ideas should be estimated and compared to the current strategic road-map. 

Improvements that could be short term implemented (quick wins) will be directly highlighted to the plant management team during regular steering team meetings for decision. ( And to the extent possible implemented during the durability of this internship). Longer term project ideas proposed by this project will serve as base for decision in early 2020 by the management team for a potential adjustment of the current manufacturing strategy.
 
In this work, you will be supported by the entire production team in Gothenburg and in particular by our Production Manager and Supply Chain Manager.
